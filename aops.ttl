  dc:description "As a neurotoxicity endpoint, information with regard to the seizure or epilepsy is often used by regulators such as EPA, FDA and DHS for human and environmental health assessment and regulation of chemicals, drugs and other materials. For instance, the Office of Pesticide Programs (OPP) in US EPA, regulates, monitors and investigates&nbsp;the use of all pesticides in accordance with the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-federal-insecticide-fungicide-and-rodenticide-act).&nbsp;Many pesticides like fipronil target the iGABAR causing&nbsp;seizure and mortality. Another example is the regulatory actions of US FDA to ensure drug safety&nbsp;(see https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm436494.htm)."@en ;

  dc:description "Chemicals non-competitively bind at or near the central pore of the receptor complex (e.g., the picrotoxin site) and directly block chloride conductance through the ion channel (Kalueff 2007). It has been postulated that they fit a single &quot;big picrotoxin binding pocket&quot;&nbsp;in the chloride channel lumen lined by five TM2 segments (Kalueff 2007; Olsen 2006). This hypothesis was examined with the &beta;3 homopentamer by mutagenesis, pore structure studies, ligand binding, and molecular modeling (Chen et al. 2006). Results suggest that they fit the 2&#39; to 9&#39; pore region forming hydrogen bonds with the T6&#39; hydroxyl and hydrophobic interactions with A2&#39;, T6&#39;, and L9&#39; alkyl substituents, thereby blocking the channel. More computational evidence can be found in Sander et al. (2011), Carpenter et al. (2013) and Zheng et al. (2014)."@en ;

  dc:description "Ionotropic GABA receptors (iGABARs) are ligand-gated ion channels which play important functional roles in the nervous system. As the major player in inhibitory neurotransmission, iGABARs are widely distributed in&nbsp;both vertebrates and invertebrates (McGonigle&nbsp;and Lummis 2010; Garcia-Reyero et al. 2011). In vertebrates, the iGABAR includes two subclasses of fast-responding ion channels, GABAA receptor (GABAA-R) and GABAC receptor (GABAC-R). Invertebrate iGABARs do not readily fit the vertebrate GABAA/GABAC receptor categories (Sieghart 1995). The majority of insect iGABARs are distinguished from vertebrate GABAA receptors by their insensitivity to bicuculline and differ from GABAC-Rs in that they are subject to allosteric modulation, albeit weakly, by benzodiazepines and barbiturates (Hosie et al. 1997).  Chemical interactions with iGABARs can cause a variety of pharmacological and neurotoxicological effects depending on the location of the active or allosteric site affected. Three distinct types of interactions at binding sites on iGABARs can antagonize the postsynaptic inhibitory functions of GABA and lead to epileptic seizures and death. These three types of interactions correspond to three AOPs (Gong et al. 2015). One of the three types of&nbsp;interaction is non-competitive channel blocking at the picrotoxin convulsant site located inside of the iGABAR pore that spans neuronal cell membranes, which is the MIE described in the current AOP. The other two types of interactions are negative modulation at allosteric sites and competitive binding at the active orthosteric sites (MIEs to be developed in the future).  It is worth noting that there exist another class of GABA receptors called metabotropic G-protein-coupled receptors (mGABAR) or GABAB receptors. This AOP is not applicable to GABAB receptors because they mediate slow and sustained inhibitory responses to GABA and are involved in absence epilepsy (Han et al. 2012)."@en ;

  dc:description "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been specifically designed to inhibit cyclooxygenase active site of PTGS; these mechanisms of inhibition are well characterized (Simmons et al, 2004). NSAIDs interfere with COX site via multiple mechanisms including competitive inhibition (most NSAIDs compete for active site with arachidonic acid) and covalent modification (irreversible acetylation) of COX (e.g., aspirin) (Simmons et al., 2004; Willoughby et al., 2011). NSAIDs display different levels of selectivity for the COX-1 vs. COX-2 isoforms (Simmons et al., 2004). Majority of NSAIDs inhibit both isoforms (with variable levels of selectivity for COX-1 vs. COX-2), but several have been designed to preferentially inhibit COX-2 (Bacchi et al., 2012). Recently, COX-1 specific inhibitors have been developed and their therapeutic potential is being explored (Liedtke et al., 2012). Most extensive evidence regarding chemical initiation of this event comes from the mammalian literature and relates to NSAIDs. In addition to NSAIDs, common environmental contaminants of diverse chemical structures and uses (e.g., parabens, phthalates, benzophenones) have been postulated to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis via COX inhibition (Kristensen et al., 2011). U.S. EPA’s high throughput screening program (ACToR, epa.gov) indicated COX as a frequent contaminant target - 61% of 143 tested chemicals inhibited COX-1 and 59% of 106 inhibited COX-2 activity. Several chemicals were either similar in potency (e.g., monobutylphthalate) or more potent than NSAIDs (e.g., insecticide emamectin benzoate and industrial intermediary 1-Chloro-4-nitrobenzene were more potent inhibitors of COX2 than NSAID celecoxib, which was specifically designed to inhibit COX-2). Mechanisms of inhibition for these chemicals are not well elucidated."@en ;

  dc:description "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been specifically designed to inhibit cyclooxygenase active site of PTGS; these mechanisms of inhibition are well characterized (Simmons et al, 2004). NSAIDs interfere with COX site via multiple mechanisms including competitive inhibition (most NSAIDs compete for active site with arachidonic acid) and covalent modification (irreversible acetylation) of COX (e.g., aspirin) (Simmons et al., 2004; Willoughby et al., 2011). NSAIDs display different levels of selectivity for the COX-1 vs. COX-2 isoforms (Simmons et al., 2004). Majority of NSAIDs inhibit both isoforms (with variable levels of selectivity for COX-1 vs. COX-2), but several have been designed to preferentially inhibit COX-2 (Bacchi et al., 2012). Recently, COX-1 specific inhibitors have been developed and their therapeutic potential is being explored (Liedtke et al., 2012). Most extensive evidence regarding chemical initiation of this event comes from the mammalian literature and relates to NSAIDs. In addition to NSAIDs, common environmental contaminants of diverse chemical structures and uses (e.g., parabens, phthalates, benzophenones) have been postulated to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis via COX inhibition (Kristensen et al., 2011). U.S. EPA’s high throughput screening program (ACToR, epa.gov) indicated COX as a frequent contaminant target - 61% of 143 tested chemicals inhibited COX-1 and 59% of 106 inhibited COX-2 activity. Several chemicals were either similar in potency (e.g., monobutylphthalate) or more potent than NSAIDs (e.g., insecticide emamectin benzoate and industrial intermediary 1-Chloro-4-nitrobenzene were more potent inhibitors of COX2 than NSAID celecoxib, which was specifically designed to inhibit COX-2).

  dc:description "Various international regulatory agencies have established policies and practices for the assessment and management of heritable mutagenic hazards. Indeed, heritable effects are an important regulatory endpoint noted by agencies around the world [Yauk et al., 2015a].  The World Health Organization (WHO)/International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) developed a harmonized scheme for mutagenicity testing. In this document the relationship between somatic cell mutagenicity and germ cell risk is summarized as: &ldquo;For substances that give positive results for mutagenic effects in somatic cells in vivo, their potential to affect germ cells should be considered. If there is toxicokinetic or toxicodynamic evidence that germ cells are actually exposed to the somatic mutagen or its bioactive metabolites, it is reasonable to assume that the substance may also pose a mutagenic hazard to germ cells and thus a risk to future generations.&rdquo; [Eastmond et al., 2009].  Thus, assessment of heritable mutagenic hazards such as aneuploidy, are an important regulatory endpoint. During drug and chemical development, agents that induce aneuploidy would not be developed further. There is currently not a specific example that can be referenced of a regulatory decision based on this adverse outcome. However, the UK Committee on Mutagenicity of Chemicals in Foods, Consumer Products and the Environment in its 2007 annual report (https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/com-guidance-statements) did recommend that the risk assessment of certain benzimidazoles be conducted solely on the aneugenic properties of these compounds.  The development of AOPs related to mutagenicity in germ cells [Yauk et al., 2015b; 2016] is expected to aid the identification of potential hazards to germ cell genomic integrity and support regulatory efforts to protect population health."@en ;

  dc:description "Colchicine is a prototypical spindle poison that has been extensively used to investigate binding to tubulin. The kinetics of colchicine binding are well established [Lambeir and Engelborghs, 1981; Engelborghs, 1998] and can be measured experimentally with high precision [Hamel and Lin, 1981]. Colchicine binds non-polymerized &alpha;/&beta; dimeric tubulin by a two-step process. The first step is rapid but weak, resulting in the formation of an initial pre-equilibrium complex, which involves a low affinity binding of colchicine that is reversible. This is followed by slow conformational changes in tubulin, which finally lead to the formation of an irreversible final state tubulin&ndash;colchicine complex that has high activation energy [Garland 1978]. The conformational change in tubulin heterodimers, followed by the addition of the complex at the ends of microtubules, is responsible for the suppressed polymerization at microtubule ends leading to their depolymerization [Ravelli et al., 2004]. The binding kinetics have been studied at different temperatures. The standard enthalpy change of the first step (&Delta;H&deg;1 = -33&plusmn;8 kJ &middot; mol&ndash;1) and the activation energy of the second step (&Delta;H&deg;2 = 100&plusmn;5 kJ &middot; mol&ndash;1) were determined based on the temperature dependence [Lambeir and Engelborghs, 1981]. Using eight different analogues to study the binding mechanisms of colchicine, it was demonstrated that the C-ring of colchicine is responsible for the first step of the binding mechanism, while the second step involves the rearrangement of the initial complex to interact with the A-ring [Engelborghs, 1998].  Other chemicals are also known to bind to tubulin [Marchetti et al., 2016]. These chemicals can be grouped in two general classes: colchicine domain binders and vinca domain binders.  Known colchicine domain binders:  1. Podophyllotoxin ((5R,5aR,8aR,9R)-5-hydroxy-9-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-5a,6,8a,9-tetrahydro-5H-[2]benzofuro[5,6-f][1,3]benzodioxol-8-one, POD) has a trimethoxybenzoic chemical structure similar to colchicine. It inhibits colchicine binding to the colchicine-binding domain of tubulin. However, although colchicine and podophyllotoxin bind in the same pocket on &beta;-tubulin, their binding sites are not completely overlapping [Desbene and Giorgi-Renault 2002].  2. 2-methoxyestradiol ((8R,9S,13S,14S,17S)-2-methoxy-13-methyl-6,7,8,9,11,12,14,15,16,17-decahydrocyclopenta[a]phenanthrene-3,17-diol, 2ME) binds to the colchicine domain of tubulin [D&#39;Amato et al. 1994].  3. Nocodazole (methyl (5-[2-thienylcarbonyl]-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl, NOC) belongs to the group of benzimidazole derivatives that were patented, as a class, for the treatment of cancer in conjunction with other pharmaceuticals. Nocodazole has been shown to bind in the colchicine domain [Xu et al. 2002].  4. Benomyl (methyl N-[1-(butylcarbamoyl)benzimidazol-2-yl]carbamate, BEN), another benzimidazole derivative, is the active compound in several agricultural fungicides. The benomyl-binding site is located in the core of &beta;-tubulin at a site distinct from the colchicine domain [Clement et al. 2008].  5. Carbendazim (methyl N-(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)carbamate, MBC) is a fungicide commonly used in agriculture for the control of a wide range of fungal diseases. Carbendazim is the methylbenzimidazolcarbamate product of the spontaneous hydrolyzation process incurred by benomyl in aqueous solution (it is the major metabolite). Therefore, it is at least partially responsible for the benomyl effects observed in vivo. The affinity of carbendazim for mammalian tubulin is less than that of benomyl, most probably because it lacks the position 1 side chain of benomyl. Like benomyl, carbendazim does not compete with colchicine for binding to tubulin [Yenjerla et al., 2008].  6. Thiabendazole (4-(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)-1,3-thiazole, TBZ) is a benzimidazole-derived anthelmintic and an agricultural fungicide, structurally related to NOC, benomyl and MBC. TBZ competitively inhibits MBC binding to fungal tubulin [Davidse and Flach, 1978].  7. ABT-751 (N-(2-((4-hydroxyphenyl)amino)pyridin-3-yl)-4-methoxybenzenesulfonamide) has a scaffold based on a benzsulfamide group. It was identified as a potent antiproliferative agent and was subsequently found to be an antitubulin agent by targeting the colchicine binding site [Yoshimatsu et al., 1997].  8. A compound base on m-ethoxyaniline group (2-(6-ethoxy-3-(3-ethoxyphenylamino)-1-methyl-1,4-dihydroindeno[1,2-c]pyrazol-7-yloxy)acetamide) showed noteworthy low nanomolar potency against cancer cell lines. In mechanistic studies, it inhibited tubulin polymerization and disorganized microtubule by binding to tubulin colchicine binding site [Liu et al., 2016].  Vinca domain binders:  The vinca alkaloids, a class of antimitotic compounds derived from the periwinkle plant, Catharanthus roseus [Cutts et al., 1960], bind near the GTP-binding site on the &beta;-subunit of tubulin at a site distinct from the colchicine-binding one [Rai and Wolff 1996]. Vinblastine and vincristine are ﬁrst-generation vinca alkaloids [Kingston, 2009]. At low concentrations, vincas bind to the plus ends of microtubules producing a conformational change of dimers from a straight &lsquo;&lsquo;growing&rsquo;&rsquo; vector to a curved &lsquo;&lsquo;peeling&rsquo;&rsquo; vector [Toso et al., 1993]. At higher concentrations, the vinca alkaloids have afﬁnity for free tubulin heterodimers, again potentially forming an altered, curved geometry of the dimeric biological vector [Warfield and Bouck, 1974]. Although vincas do not share structural similarity with colchicine and bind to a different site on tubulin, they similarly act by destabilizing microtubules [Stanton et al., 2011].  Vinca domain binders include:  1. Vinblastine (dimethyl (2&beta;,3&beta;,4&beta;,5&alpha;,12&beta;,19&alpha;)-15-[(5S,9S)-5-ethyl-5-hydroxy-9-(methoxycarbonyl)-1,4,5,6,7,8,9,10-octahydro-2H-3,7-methanoazacycloundecino[5,4b]indol-9-yl]-3-hydroxy-16-methoxy-1-methyl-6,7-didehydroaspidospermidine-3,4-dicarboxylate, VBL) is an anticancer drug that is used extensively. The crystal structure of vinblastine bound to tubulin has been determined [Gigant et al., 2005]. In contrast with the binding site for colchicine, which is mostly embedded in &beta;-tubulin subunit, the vinblastine binding site is shared equally between &alpha;/&beta;-heterodimer [Marchetti et al., 2016]. In the &beta;-subunit, vinblastine interacts through van der Waals contacts with residues Ser&beta;174-Asp&beta;179, Asn&beta;206-Asp&beta;211, Phe&beta;214 and Tyr&beta;224; while in the &alpha;-subunit, Phe&alpha;351, Lys&alpha;352, Val&alpha;353 and Ile&alpha;355 delimit the pocket occupied by VBL. Amino acids Pro&beta;222 and Asn&alpha;329 are also involved in hydrogen bond interactions with VBL [Marchetti et al., 2016]. Following a mechanism similar to colchicine, VBL binds to tubulin in two consecutive steps: formation of a rapid equilibrium complex followed by a slower rearrangement linked to changes in the structure of the heterodimer. A major effect of VBL is the formation of spiral-like tubulin aggregates [Weisenberg and Timasheff, 1970; Himes, 1991]. VBL binds to microtubule ends [Wilson et al., 1982] and at low concentrations suppresses the dynamic instability of plus ends [Toso et al., 1993]. When used at much higher concentrations, VBL depolymerizes microtubules, giving rise in particular to protofilament spirals and curls.  2. Vincristine (methyl (3aR,3a1R,4R,5S,5aR,10bR)-4-acetoxy-3a-ethyl-9-((5S,7S,9S)-5-ethyl-5-hydroxy-9-(methoxycarbonyl)1,4,5,6,7,8,9,10-octahydro-2H-3,7-methano[1]azacycloundecino[5,4-b]indol-9-yl)-6-formyl-5-hydroxy-8-methoxy-3a,3a1,4,5,5a,6,11,12-octahydro-1H-indolizino[8,1-cd]carbasole-5-carboxylate, VCR) is an anticancer drug that binds to tubulin in the vinca binding domain [Kingston, 2009].  3. Vinflunine (methyl (3aR,3a1R,4R,5S,5aR,10bR)-4-acetoxy-9-((4R,6R,8S)-4-(1,1-difluoroethyl)-8-(methoxycarbonyl)-1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9-octahydro-2,6-methanoazecino[4,3-b]indol-8-yl)-3a-ethyl-5-hydroxy-8-methoxy-6-methyl-3a,3a1,4,5,5a,6,11,12-octahydro-1H-indolizino[8,1-cd]carbazole-5-carboxylate) is a florinated Vinca alkaloid, like vinblastine and vincristine, and appears to interact at the Vinca binding domain [Kruczynski et al., 1998].  4. Vintafolide ((2R,5S,8S,11S,14S,19S)-19-(4-(((2-amino-4-oxo-3,4-dihydropteridin-6-yl)methyl)amino)benzamido)-5,8,14-tris(carboxymethyl)-2-(((2-((2-((3aR,3a1R,4R,5S,5aR,10bR)-3a-ethyl-9-((5S,7R,9S)-5-ethyl-5-hydroxy-9-(methoxycarbonyl)-1,4,5,6,7,8,9,10-octahydro-2H-3,7-methano[1]azacycloundecino[5,4-b]indol-9-yl)-4,5-dihydroxy-8-methoxy-6-methyl-3a,3a1,4,5,5a,6,11,12-octahydro-1H-indolizino[8,1-cd]carbazole-5-carbonyl)hydrazine-1-carbonyl)oxy)ethyl)disulfanyl)methyl)-11-(3-guanidinopropyl)-4,7,10,13,16-pentaoxo-3,6,9,12,15-pentaazaicosanedioic acid) is a drug conjugate consisting of a small molecule targeting the folate receptor and vinblastine. Vintafolide is designed to deliver vinblastine selectively to cells over-expressing the folate receptor such as ovarian cancer cells [Vergote and Leamon, 2015]."@en ;

  dc:description "Aneuploidy is associated with serious human health effects. Approximately 10&ndash;30% of human zygotes, 50% of spontaneous abortions, and 0.3% of human newborns are aneuploid [Hassold et al., 2007; Nagaoka et al., 2012; Webster and Schuh, 2017]. Cytogenetic analyses of human oocytes and preimplantation embryos have reported frequencies of aneuploidy in excess of 50% [Magli et al., 2001; Munne, 2002; Kuliev et al., 2003]. In these studies, the overall aneuploidy frequency is estimated from the analysis of a subset of chromosomes, which may affect the accuracy of the estimate.  Aneuploidy can affect any chromosome [Nagaoka et al., 2012; Webster and Schuh, 2017], although there is evidence that acrocentric chromosomes may be more frequently involved in aneuploidy than metacentric chromosomes [Nicolaidis and Petersen, 1998; Hassold et al., 2007; Gianaroli et al., 2010]. In humans, only trisomies for a few autosomal chromosomes (13, 18 and 21) and aneuploidies of the sex chromosomes are compatible with life. These aneuploidies have important developmental, neurological and reproductive effects. Trisomy 21 or Down syndrome, with an occurrence of ~1/720 births, is the most common genetic abnormality in newborns [Hassold et al., 2007].  The etiology of human aneuploidy is still not well understood, although there is strong evidencesupporting a preferential occurrence during female meiosis I and a positive correlation with maternal age [Hunt and Hassold, 2002; Nagaoka et al., 2012]. The prevalence of chromosome segregation errors during female meiosis is clearly supported by the application of state-of-the-art genomic approaches, such as Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH), array-Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH), SNP-arrays [Handyside, 2012; Nagaoka et al., 2012] and next generation sequencing (NGS) [Hou et al., 2013; Kung et al., 2015; Treff et al., 2016].   The present AOP focuses on chemical binding to tubulin that causes depolymerization of microtubules and generation of aneuploid cells. Although this molecular initiating event can occur in any cell, the adverse outcome is the generation of aneuploid conceptuses; therefore, this AOP is specific to germ cells, and in particular, to female germ cells.  &nbsp;  References  Gianaroli L, Magli MC, Cavallini G, Crippa A, Capoti A, Resta S, Robles F, Ferraretti AP. 2010.

  dc:description "Stressors of CAR (i.e. chemicals that activate CAR) can be quite species-specific, due to the heterogeneity of the amino acid sequence of CAR, particularly in the ligand binding domain. TCPOBOP (1,4-bis-[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene, 3,3&prime;,5,5&prime;-tetrachloro-1,4-bis(pyridyloxy)benzene) is a very potent direct CAR activator in the mouse (Huang et al., 2005;&nbsp; Omiecinski et al., 2011b). In reporter assays for CAR from mouse, rat, human and dog, TCPOBOP was shown to be a strong activator of mouse CAR (28-fold), but it showed no activation of rat and dog CAR, and only a minimal activation of human CAR (3-fold) (Omiecinski et al., 2011b). Consistent with this potent activation in mice, &nbsp;studies in wild-type and CAR-null mice showed that absence of the CAR receptor effectively blocked CAR-mediated downstream effects including gene activation (Tojima et al., 2012), cell proliferation (Huang et al., 2005;&nbsp; Wei et al., 2000) and &nbsp;formation of liver tumors (Diwan et al., 1992;&nbsp; Huang et al., 2005).  Metofluthrin is a potent activator of CAR in rats, and produces liver tumors in chronic toxicity studies in male and female Wistar rats, but&nbsp;no liver tumors in male and female CD-1 mice&nbsp;(Yamada et al., 2009). In rats, metofluthrin produced significant increases in gene expression of CAR-responsive genes Cyp2b1/2 and Cyp3a1, increased cell proliferation and increased indirect markers of CAR activation such as CYP2B protein levels and hepatocellular hypertrophy. While metofluthrin was&nbsp;not tested in CAR-null rats, isolated rat hepatocyte cultures treated with metofluthrin and siRNA for CAR (a gene silencing technique) caused a knockdown of Car mRNA expression and resulting suppression of the response to metofluthrin in terms of Cyp2b1 mRNA and Car mRNA levels (Deguchi et al., 2009). This suppression indicates that metofluthrin produces its in vivo effects in rats via activation of CAR.  Phenobarbital is an indirect activator of CAR, in that it does not bind directly to the ligand binding domain, but instead binds to an&nbsp;EGF receptor to initiate a series of steps that eventually dephosphorylate a critical Threonine-38 residue in CAR, allowing it to migrate into the nucleus and alter gene expression (Mutoh et al., 2009;&nbsp; Mutoh et al., 2013;&nbsp; Swales and Negishi, 2004). Downstream events following CAR activation by phenobarbital have been shown to be essentially the same as with direct CAR activators, and include Cyp2b10 gene expression, cell proliferation and increases in mouse liver tumors (Huang et al., 2005), which are prevented by treatment of CAR-null mice lacking the CAR receptor (Huang et al., 2005;&nbsp; Wei et al., 2000;&nbsp; Yamamoto et al., 2004). Thus, lack of these downstream key events in CAR-null mice, including an initiation-promotion study, has been used to demonstrate that phenobarbital activates the CAR receptor in mice."@en ;

  dc:description "In&nbsp;chronic carcinogenicity studies conducted in rats and mice as part of the registration process for drugs, agrochemicals and other xenobiotics, a frequent finding after high dose treatments is hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in the liver (Cohen, 2010; Gold et al., 2005). An AOP via activation of the CAR nuclear receptor is one well-understood mechanism by which these tumors can occur (Elcombe et al., 2014).&nbsp; An overall framework for describing a mode of action (Anderson et al., 2014; Meek et al., 2014) has established that a mode of action (or an AOP)&nbsp;can be described based on a series of Key Events (KEs), which are causal and required precursor steps to the AO.&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies comparing the postulated KEs in various species (e.g. rat, mouse, hamster, guinea pig, non-human primate) as well as in human hepatocytes or humans on&nbsp;chronic treatment with CAR activating drugs, have indicated large species differences in the susceptibility to 1) certain key events including KE2&nbsp;(cell proliferation) and 2) the ability of CAR activators to produce liver tumors. The main purpose of this AOP is to outline the measurable key events for an AOP via CAR activation that leads to liver tumors in rats and mice. However, by summarizing experimental results across a wider range of mammalian species, the AOP outlines species differences relating to the KEs and the AO. By this approach, it is intended that the AOP can help the wider scientific and regulatory community to recognize the measurable KEs that would indicate a xenobiotic produces liver effects via this AOP, and the methods typically employed to demonstrate the thresholds in dose-response, below which no KEs and no tumors have been shown to occur in rats and/or mice with model CAR activators.  Published summaries regarding the CAR mode of action (Elcombe et al., 2014; Peffer et al., 2018a; Peffer et al., 2018b; Lake, 2018) have identified a similar set of KEs, and they also identify associatve events, which are biological processes that are not necessary for the AOP, but can often be used as surrogate markers for a&nbsp;particular KE (Anderson et al., 2014).&nbsp; The associative events that follow CAR activation include:&nbsp; 1)&nbsp;Increased CYP2B, CYP3A enzyme activity and/or protein in hepatocytes; 2) increased hepatocellular hypertrophy; and 3) increased liver weight.&nbsp; Based on the guidance for writing AOPs, this current AOP on CAR activation leading to rodent hepatocellular tumors does not specifically include&nbsp;associative events within the graphical illustration (Figure 1),&nbsp;but instead identifies them within the&nbsp;context of &quot;How the KE is measured&quot; within each individual KE or KER.&nbsp;&nbsp;These associative events&nbsp;are readily measured in the course of many toxicology studies, and provide useful markers for the KEs that are part of the CAR AOP.&nbsp;&nbsp;  CAR (NR1I3) and PXR (pregnane X receptor; NR1I2)) are often cited together regarding potential mode(s) of action (MoA)&nbsp;for a specific chemical agent, because they are from the same family of nuclear receptors and exhibit extensive cross-talk in terms of the set of genes and response elements that they can activate (Stanley et al., 2006).&nbsp;In the published proceedings of a nuclear receptor workshop on the CAR / PXR MoA (Andersen et al., 2014; Elcombe et al., 2014), the authors could not identify a suitable nongenotoxic PXR activator for which carcinogenicity data were available, and hence a MoA was not developed for liver tumor formation by PXR&nbsp;activators. Some agents can activate both CAR and PXR in a particular species (Elcombe et al., 2014). In fact, PXR is activated by a large array of chemical substances, far more than those that activate CAR (Martin et al., 2010; Timsit and Negishi, 2007; Willson and Kliewer, 2002). PXR has been shown to increase liver weight after activation by a number of substrates, but suspected activators of PXR such as pregnenolone-16&alpha;-carbonitrile or dexamethasone have not consistently shown increases in assays for cell proliferation in rats and mice (Lake et al., 1998;&nbsp; Shizu et al., 2013; Thatcher and Caldwell, 1994). PXR activation is classically considered to selectively induce increased expression of CYP3A isoforms, with lesser induction of CYP2B isoforms, but again, cross-talk between PXR and CAR receptors upon activation of either nuclear receptor can be part of the altered expression of these Cyp isoforms in vivo. Given the lack of actual tumorigenic key events due to PXR activators alone, the rest of this current AOP will focus on the CAR&nbsp;mode of action&nbsp;by itself.  The&nbsp;AOP submitted here is limited to a definitive set of readily measurable endpoints that encompass the KEs that are critical to the progression from CAR activation to liver tumor formation, and differentiate an agent that works via CAR activation from one that operates by alternative modes of action. &nbsp;Therefore, not all of the possible biochemical steps discussed by Elcombe et al. (2014) or proposed in other publications are shown&nbsp;(Phillips and Goodman, 2008; Moennikes et al., 2000, Huang et al., 2005; Brauening et al., 2016).&nbsp;&nbsp;While suppression of apoptosis, changes in DNA methylation status or inhibition of gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) have been shown to occur in rodent liver after treatment with CAR activators such as phenobarbital (Huang et al., 2005; Klaunig et al., 1990; Moennikes et al., 2000; Phillips and Goodman, 2008), these were viewed by Elcombe et al. (2014)&nbsp;as associative events, since clear demonstrations of essentiality and/or association with CAR activation have not been established. More importantly regarding the AOP for CAR activation, these possible associative events require specialized techniques to demonstrate them, such as micro-injection of individual hepatocytes with dye in the case of GJIC (Klaunig et al., 1990), or examination of apoptosis within altered foci at later time points in longer-term studies (Kolaja et al., 1996b). Considering the specialized methods needed and the fact that these&nbsp;associative events&nbsp;are not considered essential to demonstrating the overall AOP, they are not included in the set of KEs&nbsp;described in this AOP (Figure 1 and Table&nbsp;1).&nbsp; As with all of the AOPs on the AOPwiki site, this AOP for rodent liver tumors via CAR activation may be modified in the future to include additional or different KEs and experimental markers of those KEs&nbsp;as the understanding of these toxicological processes evolves.&nbsp;  Table 1 (see below)  In Table 1, the typical data that is generated to demonstrate a molecule produces a liver tumor response in mice or rats via CAR activation AOP is described. However, this should not be viewed as a set of required studies, as other techniques are available that can lead to the same endpoint of demonstrating the KEs in a CAR AOP, or markers for them. A more thorough description of current and emerging methods for identifying a CAR mode of action with a particular molecule is available in Peffer et al., 2018b."@en ;

  dc:description "Thyroid Disrupting Chemicals (TDCs) are defined as the xenobiotics that interfere with the thyroid axis with different outcomes for the organism. A very well-studied mechanism of action of the TDCs is the reduction of the circulating levels of THs by inhibiting hormone synthesis in the thyroid gland. For example, perchlorate is a very potent inhibitor of iodide uptake through the sodium/iodide symporter (Tonacchera et al., 2004). Perchlorate has been detected in human breast milk ranging from 1.4 to 92.2 mg &mu;l&ndash;1 (10.5 &mu;g l&ndash;1 mean) in 18 US states (Kirk et al. 2005), and 1.3 to 411 &mu;g l&ndash;1 (9.1 &mu;g l&ndash;1 median) in the Boston area, United States (Pearce et al. 2007). Perchlorate has also been detected in human colostrum of 46 women in the Boston area (from &lt; 0.05 to 187.2 &mu;mol l&ndash;1 (Leung et al. 2009)). The mechanism of perchlorate action is quite simple, as it is believed to be mediated only by the NIS inhibition (Dohan et al., 2007; Wolff, 1998). Additionally, thiocyanate and nitrate are two known inhibitors that have been found to reduce circulating TH levels (Blount et al., 2006; Steinhaus et al., 2007), but they are both less potent than perchlorate (Tonacchera et al., 2004). However, there are also contradictory results from other studies that showed no correlation between thyroid parameters and perchlorate levels in humans (Pearce et al., 2010; Amitai et al., 2007; Tellez et al., 2005).  Co-occurrence of perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate can alter thyroid function in pregnant women. Horton et al. (2015) have shown positive associations between the weighted sum of urinary concentrations of these three analytes and increased TSH, with perchlorate showing the largest weight in the index. Interestingly, De Groef et al. 2006 showed that nitrate and thiocyanate, acquired through drinking water or food, account for a much larger proportion of iodine uptake inhibition than perchlorate, suggesting that NIS inhibition and any potential downstream effect by perchlorate are highly dependent on the presence of other environmental NIS inhibitors and iodine intake itself (Leung et al., 2010). In particular, Tonacchera et al. (2004) showed that the relative potency of perchlorate to inhibit radioactive I&minus; uptake by NIS is 15, 30 and 240 times that of thiocyanate, iodide, and nitrate respectively on a molar concentration basis. These data are in line with earlier studies in rats (Alexander and Wolff, 1996; Greer et al. 1966). Contradictory findings in these studies may therefore be a result of the confounding mixtures in the environment, masking the primary effect of perchlorate.  Decreased iodine intake can decrease TH production, and therefore exposure to perchlorate might be particularly detrimental in iodine-deficient individuals (Leung et al. 2010). Moreover, biologically based dose-response modeling of the relationships among iodide status (e.g., dietary iodine levels), perchlorate dose, and TH production in pregnant women has shown that iodide intake has a profound effect on the likelihood that exposure to goitrogens will produce hypothyroxinemia (Lewandowski et al. 2015).  During pregnancy TH requirements increase, particularly during the first trimester (Alexander et al. 2004; Leung et al. 2010), due to higher concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, placental T4 inner-ring deiodination leading to the inactive reverse T3 (rT3), and transfer of small amounts of T4 to the foetus (during the first trimester foetal thyroid function is absent). Moreover, glomerular filtration rate and clearance of proteins and other molecules are both increased during pregnancy, possibly causing increased renal iodide clearance and a decreased of circulating plasma iodine (Glinoer, 1997). Thus, even though the foetal thyroid can trap iodide by about 12 week of gestation (Fisher and Klein, 1981), high concentrations of maternal perchlorate may potentially decrease thyroidal iodine available to the foetus by inhibiting placental NIS (Leung et al. 2010).  Consequences of TH deficiency depend on the developmental timing of the deficiency (Zoeller and Rovet, 2004). For instance, if the TH deficiency occurs during early pregnancy, offspring show visual attention, visual processing and gross motor skills deficits, while if it occurs later, offspring may show subnormal visual and visuospatial skills, along with slower response speeds and motor deficits. If TH insufficiency occurs after birth, language and memory skills are most predominantly affected (Zoeller and Rovet, 2004).  Along this line, age and developmental stage are crucial in determining sensitivity to NIS inhibitors (e.g., perchlorate, thiocyanate, and nitrate). In this regard, McMullen et al. (2017) have shown that adolescent boys and girls, more than adults, represent vulnerable subpopulations to NIS symporter inhibitors. Altogether these studies indicate that age, gender, developmental stage, and dietary iodine levels can affect the impact of NIS inhibitors.  Finally, ten more small simple-structured molecules were identified in a large screening study (Lecat-Guillet et al., 2008b) that could block iodide uptake by specifically disrupting NIS in a dose-dependent manner. These molecules were named Iodide Transport Blockers (ITBs). There are few organic molecules that lead to NIS inhibition but no direct interaction with NIS has been determined (Gerard et al., 1994; Kaminsky et al., 1991). Up to date, only dysidenin, a toxin isolated from the marine sponge Dysidea herbacea, has been reported to specifically inhibit NIS (Van Sande et al., 2003). Finally, the aryltrifluoroborates were found to inhibit iodide uptake with an IC50 value of 0.4 &mu;M on rat-derived thyroid cells (Lecat-Guillet et al., 2008a). The biological activity is rationalized by the presence of the BF3&minus; ion as a minimal binding motif for substrate recognition at the iodide binding site.  It has been also shown that many anions, such as ClO3-, SCN-, NO3-, ReO4-, TcO4- and in a lower extent Br- and BF4-, are also acting as NIS substrates and they enter the cell by the same transporter mechanism (Van Sande et al., 2003). It has been also shown that ClO4- is transferred by NIS with high affinity and is considered as one of its most potent inhibitors (Dohan et al., 2007). Most recently, the aryltrifluoroborates were also shown to inhibit NIS function (Lecat-Guillet et al., 2008a). A library of 17,020 compounds was tested by a radioactive screening method with high specificity using transfected mammalian cells (Lecat-Guillet et al., 2008b; 2007) for NIS inhibition evaluation. Further studies with the most powerful inhibitors showed a high diversity in their structure and mode of action (Lindenthal et al., 2009)."@en ;

  dc:description "Characterization of chemical properties: Androgen receptor binding chemicals can be grouped into two broad structural domains, steroidal and non-steroidal (Yin et al. 2003). Steroidal androgens consist primarily of testosterone and its derivatives (Yin et al. 2003). Many of the non-steroidal AR binding chemicals studied are derivatives of well known non-steroidal AR antagonists like bicalutamide, hydroxyflutamide, and nilutamide (Yin et al. 2003). Nonetheless, a number of QSARs and SARs that consider AR binding of both these pharmaceutical agents as well as environmental chemicals have been developed (Waller et al. 1996; Serafimova et al. 2002; Todorov et al. 2011; Hong et al. 2003; Bohl et al. 2004). However, it has been shown that very minor structural differences can dramatically impact function as either an agonist or antagonist (Yin et al. 2003; Bohl et al. 2004; Norris et al. 2009), making it difficult at present to predict agonist versus antagonist activity based on chemical structure alone.  In vivo considerations: A variety of steroidal androgens can be converted to estrogens in vitro through the action of cytochrome P450 19 (aromatase). Structures subject to aromatization may behave in vivo as estrogens despite exhibiting potent androgen receptor agonism in vitro."@en ;

  dc:description "Glu and glycine are endogenous agonists that bind to LBD of specific NMDA receptor subunits. In this binding site numerous competitive exogenous antagonists have been identified to cause closure of binding site and inhibition of NMDA receptor (reviewed in Traynelis et al., 2010). Here, are listed some known competitive antagonists for NMDA receptor, some of them are specific to NR1 subunit and some to NR2 subunit:  &alpha;-AA, &alpha;-aminoadipate;  5,7-DCKA, 5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid;  7-CKA, 7-chlorokynurenic acid;  ACEA-1011, 5-chloro-7-trifluoromethyl-1,4-dihydro-2,3-quinoxalinedione;  ACEA-1021, licostinel;  AP5, 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate;  AP7, 2-amino-7-phosphonopentanoate;  CGP-61594, (&plusmn;)-trans-4-[2-(4-azidophyenyl)acetylamino]-5,7-dichloro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline-2-carboxylic acid;  CGP-40116, d-(E)-2-amino-4-methyl-5-phosphono-3-pentenoic acid;  CGP-43487, d-(E)-2-amino-4-methyl-5-phosphono-3-pentenoic acid methyl ester;  CGP-58411, 7-chloro-4-hydroxy-3-phenyl-1H-quinolin-2-one;  CGS-19755, (2R,4S)-4-(phosphonomethyl)piperidine-2-carboxylic acid;  CPP, 4-(3-phosphonopropyl) pizerazine-2-carboxylic acid;  GV150,526A, gavestinel;  GV196,771A, (E)-4,6-dichloro-3-[(2-oxo-1-phenyl-3-pyrrolidinylidene)methyl]-1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid;  L-689,560, 4-trans-2-carboxy-5,7-dichloro-4-phenylaminocarbonylamino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline;  L-701,324, 7-chloro-4-hydroxy-3-(3-phenoxy)phenyl-2(1H)-quinolone;  MDL105,519, (E)-3-(2-phenyl-2-carboxyethenyl)-4, 6-dichloro-1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid;  PBPD, (2S,3R)-1-(biphenyl-4-carbonyl)piperazine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid;  PMPA, (R,S)-4-(phosphonomethyl)-piperazine-2-carboxylic acid;  PPDA, (2S,3R)-1-(phenanthren-2-carbonyl)piperazine-2,3-dicarboxylic acid  Besides competitive antagonists, noncompetitive antagonists have also been designed like phenylethanolamine ifenprodil that interacts with the NR2B extracellular amino-terminal domain. It has been suggested that they act by stabilizing an agonist-bound state in which the receptor has a low open probability. Other more potent derivatives of ifenprodil are: &alpha;-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-&beta;-methyl-4-(phenylmethyl)-1-piperidine propanol (Ro 25-6981), 1-[2-(4-hydroxy-phenoxy)-ethyl]-4-(4-methyl-benzyl)-piperidin-4-ol (Ro 63-1908), besonprodil (CI-1041), and traxoprodil mesylate (CP-101,606). Ethanol has been proposed to be a noncompetitive antagonist of NMDA receptors, binding to NR2 subunit (Nagy, 2008). Inhibition of NMDA receptor function by ethanol and interactions between ethanol and the noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist ifenprodil have been examined in neocortical neurons from rat and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells expressing recombinant NMDA receptors (Lovinger, 1995). Recently, a structural model has been suggested that predicts the presence of four sites of ethanol action on the NMDA receptor, each containing four pairs of positions in the NR1/NR2 subunits (reviewed in Chandrasekar, 2013). Some other antagonists can become trapped in the pore of the NMDA receptor after channel closure and these antagonists are called uncompetitive or trapping blockers. The most well studied NMDA receptor uncompetitive antagonists are Mg2+, polyamines, phencyclidine, ketamine, MK-801, memantine, amantadine, pentamidine, 9-tetrahydroaminoacridine, dextromethorphan, and its metabolite dextrorphan. MK-801 has been shown to prevent toluene-induced alterations in pattern-elicited visual-evoked potentials in vivo, suggesting the possibility that the binding site of toluene might be common with the one of MK-801 (Bale et al., 2007). However, another study suggests that toluene interference with the NMDA receptor might not be exclusively because of the binding to the channel pore (Smothers and Woodward, 2007) but it may involve some other binding sites. Lead (Pb2+) is considered a voltage independent antagonist of NMDA receptors and it is believed that possibly shares the same binding site with Zn2+ (reviewed in Neal and Guilarte, 2010; Traynelis et al., 2010). However, studies done in recombinant NR2A- and NR2B- containing NMDA receptors with mutated Zn2+ binding sites exhibit that additional structural elements, different from those important for Zn2+ binding are involved in Pb2+ binding site (reviewed in Neal and Guilarte, 2010). Similarly, there are contradicting experimental evidence and disagreement about Pb2+&#39;s role as competitive or non-competitive antagonist (Neal and Guilarte, 2010). Pb2+ -induced inhibition of NMDAR during synaptogenesis in hippocampal neurons altered synaptic NMDAR composition, resulting in a decrease in NR2A-containing NMDARs at the established synapses (Neal et al., 2011)."@en ;

It has been suggested that they act by stabilizing an agonist-bound state in which the receptor has a low open probability. Other more potent derivatives of ifenprodil are: &alpha;-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-&beta;-methyl-4-(phenylmethyl)-1-piperidine propanol (Ro 25-6981), 1-[2-(4-hydroxy-phenoxy)-ethyl]-4-(4-methyl-benzyl)-piperidin-4-ol (Ro 63-1908), besonprodil (CI-1041), and traxoprodil mesylate (CP-101,606).

MK-801 has been shown to prevent toluene-induced alterations in pattern-elicited visual-evoked potentials in vivo, suggesting the possibility that the binding site of toluene might be common with the one of MK-801 (Bale et al., 2007).

  dc:description "Currently the four available OECD Test Guidelines (TGs) for neurotoxicity testing are entirely based on in vivo neurotoxicity studies: (1)Delayed Neurotoxicity of Organophosphorus Substances Following Acute Exposure (TG 418); (2) Delayed Neurotoxicity of Organophosphorus Substances: 28-day Repeated Dose Study (TG 419); (3) Neurotoxicity Study in Rodents (TG 424) involves daily oral dosing of rats for acute, subchronic, or chronic assessments (28 days, 90 days, or one year or longer); (4) Developmental Neurotoxicity (DNT) Study (TG 426) evaluates in utero and early postnatal effects by daily dosing of at least 60 pregnant rats from implantation through lactation. One of the endpoints required by all four of these OECD TGs is evaluation of neurodegeneration that, so far, is performed through in vivo neuropathological and histological studies. Therefore, neurodegeneration described in this AOP as a key event, has a regulatory relevance and could be performed using in vitro assays that allow a reliable evaluation of neurodegeneration using a large range of existing assays, specific for apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy ( see also KE Cell injury/Cell death)."@en ;

  dc:description "The AHR can be activated by several structurally diverse chemicals, but binds preferentially to planar halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Dioxin-like compounds (DLCs), which include polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and certain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), are among the most potent AHR ligands[38]. Only a subset of PCDD, PCDF and PCB congeners has been shown to bind to the AHR and cause toxic effects to those elicited by TCDD. Until recently, TCDD was considered to be the most potent DLC in birds[39]; however, recent reports indicate that 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (PeCDF) is more potent than TCDD in some species of birds.[40][13][41][21][42][43] When screened for their ability to induce aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) activity, dioxins with chlorine atoms at a minimum of three out of the four lateral ring positions, and with at least one non-chlorinated ring position are the most active[44]. Of the dioxin-like PCBs, non-ortho congeners are the most toxicologically active, while mono-ortho PCBs are generally less potent[45][9]. Chlorine substitution at ortho positions increases the energetic costs of assuming the coplanar conformation required for binding to the AHR [45]. Thus, a smaller proportion of mono-ortho PCB molecules are able to bind to the AHR and elicit toxic effects, resulting in reduced potency of these congeners. Other PCB congeners, such as di-ortho substituted PCBs, are very weak AHR agonists and do not likely contribute to dioxin-like effects [9].   	Contrary to studies of birds and mammals, even the most potent mono-ortho PCBs bind to AhRs of fishes with very low affinity, if at all (Abnet et al 1999; Doering et al 2014; 2015; Eisner et al 2016; Van den Berg et al 1998).   The role of the AHR in mediating the toxic effects of planar hydrophobic contaminants has been well studied, however the endogenous role of the AHR is less clear [1]. Some endogenous and natural substances, including prostaglandin PGG2 and the tryptophan derivatives indole-3-carbinol, 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ) and kynurenic acid can bind to and activate the AHR. [6][46][47][48][49] The AHR is thought to have important endogenous roles in reproduction, liver and heart development, cardiovascular function, immune function and cell cycle regulation [50][38][51][52][53][54][46][55][56][57] and activation of the AHR by DLCs may therefore adversely affect these processes."@en ;

  dc:description "Heme is a cyclic tetrapyrrole cofactor containing Fe2+ porphyrin-containing ferroprotein that forms various hemoproteins such as hemoglobin, cytochromes and catalases [62]. Its biosynthesis mostly occurs in the liver and involves 8 separate steps. Porphyria is a disorder in which the disturbance of any of the steps of heme biosynthesis results in accumulation and excretion of porphyrins[2]. A variety of porphyrias exist depending on which enzyme in the pathway is deficient. This AOP describes a situation in which the 5th step of heme biosynthesis, uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD), which converts uroporphyrinogen to coproporphyrinogen, is inhibited.  Hepatic uroporphyria is viewed somewhat differently by clinicians and toxicologists. For the former it is mostly a sporadic disease (porphyria cutanea tarda; PCT) occurring sometimes in patients exposed to a variety of insults such as alcohol, estrogens, hepatitis viruses, HIV and on dialysis. Importantly, very early on it was found that lowering body iron stores by bleeding or now chelators causes remission [61]. In some northern European and US patients, carrying the hemochromatosis mutation is a risk factor but in other patients other iron susceptibility genes may contribute. Carrying a UROD mutation (lowering activity) is also a risk factor but still dependent on other susceptibility factors to see porphyria. To reproduce these findings experimentally has proved challenging but now possible. For toxicologists hepatic uroporphyria has mostly been seen as a toxic, but unique and curious endpoint of polychlorinated ligands of the AHR.&nbsp; Experimentally, TCDD in mice is the most potent agent consistent with AHR mode of action but is more difficult in rats and other organisms. Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) has been greatly studied for its porphyria-inducing abilities and a large incident of porphyria in some young people in Turkey 60 years ago was ascribed to susceptible individuals who had consumed HCB. It is controversial whether HCB is a weak AHR ligand. Evidence of porphyria in people exposed accidentally or occupationally to accepted AHR ligands such as TCDD and PCBs is thin. Importantly, iron status can profoundly modify experimental uroporphyria induced by these chemicals especially in mice. In fact iron overload alone of mice will eventually produce a strong hepatic uroporphyria which is markedly genetically determined and toxicity can be ameliorated by chelators resembling PCT. Thus hepatic porphyria could alternatively be viewed as an iron AOP. At an overall level hepatic uroporphyria in animals and patients is the outcome of complex genetic traits and external stimuli in which in some traditional toxicological circumstances binding of a chemical to the AHR may have a major contribution[67] but in others may not."@en ;

  dc:description "Thyroid Disrupting Chemicals (TDCs) are defined as the xenobiotics that interfere with the thyroid axis with different outcomes for the organism. A very well-studied mechanism of action of the TDCs is the reduction of the circulating levels of THs by inhibiting hormone synthesis in the thyroid gland. For example, perchlorate is a very potent inhibitor of iodide uptake through the sodium/iodide symporter (Tonacchera et al., 2004). Perchlorate has been detected in human breast milk ranging from 1.4 to 92.2 mg &mu;l&ndash;1 (10.5 &mu;g l&ndash;1 mean) in 18 US states (Kirk et al. 2005), and 1.3 to 411 &mu;g l&ndash;1 (9.1 &mu;g l&ndash;1 median) in the Boston area, United States (Pearce et al. 2007). Perchlorate has also been detected in human colostrum of 46 women in the Boston area (from &lt; 0.05 to 187.2 &mu;mol l&ndash;1 (Leung et al. 2009)). The mechanism of perchlorate action is quite simple, as it is believed to be mediated only by the NIS inhibition (Dohan et al., 2007; Wolff, 1998). Additionally, thiocyanate and nitrate are two known inhibitors that have been found to reduce circulating TH levels (Blount et al., 2006; Steinhaus et al., 2007), but they are both less potent than perchlorate (Tonacchera et al., 2004). However, there are also contradictory results from other studies that showed no correlation between thyroid parameters and perchlorate levels in humans (Pearce et al., 2010; Amitai et al., 2007; Tellez et al., 2005).  Co-occurrence of perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate can alter thyroid function in pregnant women. Horton et al. (2015) have shown positive associations between the weighted sum of urinary concentrations of these three analytes and increased TSH, with perchlorate showing the largest weight in the index. Interestingly, De Groef et al. 2006 showed that nitrate and thiocyanate, acquired through drinking water or food, account for a much larger proportion of iodine uptake inhibition than perchlorate, suggesting that NIS inhibition and any potential downstream effect by perchlorate are highly dependent on the presence of other environmental NIS inhibitors and iodine intake itself (Leung et al., 2010). In particular, Tonacchera et al. (2004) showed that the relative potency of perchlorate to inhibit radioactive I&minus; uptake by NIS is 15, 30 and 240 times that of thiocyanate, iodide, and nitrate respectively on a molar concentration basis. These data are in line with earlier studies in rats (Alexander and Wolff, 1996; Greer et al. 1966). Contradictory findings in these studies may therefore be a result of the confounding mixtures in the environment, masking the primary effect of perchlorate.  Decreased iodine intake can decrease TH production, and therefore exposure to perchlorate might be particularly detrimental in iodine-deficient individuals (Leung et al. 2010). Moreover, biologically based dose-response modeling of the relationships among iodide status (e.g., dietary iodine levels), perchlorate dose, and TH production in pregnant women has shown that iodide intake has a profound effect on the likelihood that exposure to goitrogens will produce hypothyroxinemia (Lewandowski et al. 2015).  During pregnancy TH requirements increase, particularly during the first trimester (Alexander et al. 2004; Leung et al. 2010), due to higher concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, placental T4 inner-ring deiodination leading to the inactive reverse T3 (rT3), and transfer of small amounts of T4 to the foetus (during the first trimester foetal thyroid function is absent). Moreover, glomerular filtration rate and clearance of proteins and other molecules are both increased during pregnancy, possibly causing increased renal iodide clearance and a decreased of circulating plasma iodine (Glinoer, 1997). Thus, even though the foetal thyroid can trap iodide by about 12 week of gestation (Fisher and Klein, 1981), high concentrations of maternal perchlorate may potentially decrease thyroidal iodine available to the foetus by inhibiting placental NIS (Leung et al. 2010).  Consequences of TH deficiency depend on the developmental timing of the deficiency (Zoeller and Rovet, 2004). For instance, if the TH deficiency occurs during early pregnancy, offspring show visual attention, visual processing and gross motor skills deficits, while if it occurs later, offspring may show subnormal visual and visuospatial skills, along with slower response speeds and motor deficits. If TH insufficiency occurs after birth, language and memory skills are most predominantly affected (Zoeller and Rovet, 2004).  Along this line, age and developmental stage are crucial in determining sensitivity to NIS inhibitors (e.g., perchlorate, thiocyanate, and nitrate). In this regard, McMullen et al. (2017) have shown that adolescent boys and girls, more than adults, represent vulnerable subpopulations to NIS symporter inhibitors. Altogether these studies indicate that age, gender, developmental stage, and dietary iodine levels can affect the impact of NIS inhibitors.  Finally, ten more small simple-structured molecules were identified in a large screening study (Lecat-Guillet et al., 2008b) that could block iodide uptake by specifically disrupting NIS in a dose-dependent manner. These molecules were named Iodide Transport Blockers (ITBs). There are few organic molecules that lead to NIS inhibition but no direct interaction with NIS has been determined (Gerard et al., 1994; Kaminsky et al., 1991). Up to date, only dysidenin, a toxin isolated from the marine sponge Dysidea herbacea, has been reported to specifically inhibit NIS (Van Sande et al., 2003). Finally, the aryltrifluoroborates were found to inhibit iodide uptake with an IC50 value of 0.4 &mu;M on rat-derived thyroid cells (Lecat-Guillet et al., 2008a). The biological activity is rationalized by the presence of the BF3&minus; ion as a minimal binding motif for substrate recognition at the iodide binding site.  It has been also shown that many anions, such as ClO3-, SCN-, NO3-, ReO4-, TcO4- and in a lower extent Br- and BF4-, are also acting as NIS substrates and they enter the cell by the same transporter mechanism (Van Sande et al., 2003). It has been also shown that ClO4- is transferred by NIS with high affinity and is considered as one of its most potent inhibitors (Dohan et al., 2007). Most recently, the aryltrifluoroborates were also shown to inhibit NIS function (Lecat-Guillet et al., 2008a). A library of 17,020 compounds was tested by a radioactive screening method with high specificity using transfected mammalian cells (Lecat-Guillet et al., 2008b; 2007) for NIS inhibition evaluation. Further studies with the most powerful inhibitors showed a high diversity in their structure and mode of action (Lindenthal et al., 2009)."@en ;

  rdfs:label "Endocytic lysosomal uptake leading to liver fibrosis"@en ;
  dc:source <https://h2020-sbd4nano.github.io/sbd-data-aopwiki/models/> ;
  dc:description "&nbsp;  Liver fibrosis is currently an important health problem potentially leading in its progressive form to cirrhosis and as such presents a significant economic burden (Lim and Kim, 2008). The only therapy for chronic liver failure is liver transplantation, with 5.500 liver transplantations in Europe on a yearly basis, costing up to &euro;100.000 (approximately US$110.000)&nbsp;the first year (Safadi and Friedman, 2002) and estimated mean cost of US$163.438 in United States (van der Hilst et al., 2008). There are constant research attempts for new therapeutic strategies, but so far without success. AOP concept presents an alternative approach which organizing mechanistic toxicological knowledge can lead to the prevention of liver fibrosis.  The use and possible applications of nanomaterials (NMs) are in constant increase, for example in food, food-related products or cosmetics. Therefore, the safety of NMs systemically taken up in the body needs to be ensured. The liver is known to be one of the main target organs for ingested NMs, but inhaled particles can also reach the liver upon clearance from the lung (Johnston et al., 2010; Cui et al., 2011; Geraets et al., 2012). In vivo experiments on gavaged or injected (intraperitoneal or intravenously) TiO2 suggest a wide range of adverse effects on the liver: an increase in general serum markers for liver damage such as Alanine Aminotransferase or Aspartate Aminotransferase (Liu et al., 2009; Duan et al., 2010), an increase in inflammatory markers such as pro-inflammatory cytokines and/or infiltration of inflammatory cells (Ma et al., 2009; Cui et al., 2011; Kermanizadeh, 2012), an increase of markers for oxidative stress (Liu et al., 2010; Soliman et al., 2013), apoptosis, necrosis and also fibrosis (Chen et al., 2009; Alarifi et al., 2013). Oral NM administration appeared to induce overall milder adverse effects than systemic administration, most likely due to the typically limited absorption of NMs in the GI tract. Thus, it is important to keep in mind that the route of exposure and the size of the NM, play an important role whether these reach the liver, and to which extent they&#39;re accumulated (Kermanizadeh, 2014).  Once a chemical is taken up by a cell, it is transported into the lysosome. In the lysosome, the acidic environment can enhance the solubility of a NM, or it remains in the initial nano form. &nbsp;Both situations can induce toxicity, causing lysosomal swelling, followed by lysosomal damage and the release of pro-apoptotic proteins (Wang et al., 2013; Cho et al., 2011; Cho et al., 2012). But not only NMs cause lysosomal damage: fluoroquinolones (Ouedraogo et al., 2000), lysosomotropic detergents such as o-methyl-serine dodecylamide hydrochloride (Villamil Giraldo et al., 2016), artesunate (Yang et al., 2014), chloroquine (Ashoor et al., 2013) can do the same, and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) such as H2O2 can amplify this effect (Repnik et al., 2012). &nbsp;The amount of lysosomal enzymes released into the cytosol regulates the cell death pathway: controlled increased permeability of lysosomal membrane, caused by limited level of stress, plays a vital role in the induction of apoptosis, whereas massive lysosomal rupture, caused by high-stress levels, leads to necrosis (Bursch, 2001; Guicciardi et al., 2004). Lysosomes are known to trigger mitochondrial-mediated cell death by the release of cathepsins into the cytosol (Repnik et al., 2012). At the same time, however, lysosomes themselves are a source of ROS, which can lead to damage of the mitochondrial membrane (Wang et al., 2013; Kubota et al., 2010). Cell death further leads to inflammation (Faouzi et al., 2001), which activates hepatic stellate cells and induce them to secrete collagen (Casini et al., 1997). It is established that collagen accumulation is a prephase&nbsp;of liver fibrosis (Bataller and Brenner, 2005; Lee and Friedman, 2011).  Overall, the connection between lysosomal and mitochondrial damage with liver inflammation and further on with fibrosis, is well known, regardless if triggered by chemicals, proteins or NMs (reviewed in Malhi and Gores, 2008; Kong et al., 2014). Therefore, due to its high importance, it is described extensively in the current AOP."@en ;

  dc:description "Several well-known drugs have lysosomotropic abilities including chloroquine, the antipsychotics chlorpromazine, thioridazine, aripiprazole, the antidepressants desipramine, imipramine, and clomipramine, as well as fluoroquinolone antibiotics; another substance group are lysosomotropic detergents (Villamil Giraldo et al., 2014; Ouedraogo et al., 2000).  Fluoroquinolones such as lomefloxacin, norfloxacin,&nbsp; BAYy 3118 and ciprofloxacin are lysosomotropic substances because of their Lewis acid&ndash;base properties characterized by pKa nearby neutrality (Ouedraogo et al. 2000). The anti-malarial and anti-inflammatory agent chloroquine is a basic lipophilic and therefore lysosomotropic compound that accumulates in lysosomes via pH partitioning (Ashoor et al. 2013). 3-aminopropanal has the structure of a weak lysosomotropic base, concentrates within the acidic vacuolar compartment and causes lysosomal rupture (Yu et al., 2003). Artesunate preferably accumulates in the lysosomes (Yang et al., 2014)  Most nanoscale macromolecules and molecular assemblies are internalized through endocytosis upon contact with the cell membrane. Intracellular trafficking of NPs following endocytosis has been reported to be mediated via the endosomal pathway through early endosomes, late endosomes and then lysosomes (Gilleron et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2013; Ng et al., 2015).&nbsp; Verma and Stellacci showed that 3.4-nm gold NPs were taken up into macrophages via pinocytosis and 24 h after internalization they were found in lysosomes. This endocytic fate has also been observed for iron oxide NPs and fullerenes (Verma and Stellacci, 2010).  Jin et al. investigated the cytotoxicity of Nanotitanium dioxide TiO2 (an industrial material used as an additive in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and food colorants and able to penetrate the skin) in mouse fibroblast (L929) cells. They saw that TiO2 NPs were phagocytosed and encapsulated in the lysosomes (Jin et al. 2008).  The rate and mechanism of NP uptake are dependent on physiochemical causes related to the properties of the NPs and the cells, but also the local microenvironment (Zhang, 2015). Nanomaterial shape and size contribute significantly to their interaction with cells (Verma and Stellacci, 2010; Oh, 2014). Several reports showing that NPs of 20&mdash;50nm are taken up more rapidly than smaller or larger particles (Lu et al., 2009; Iversen et al., 2011; Dykman and Khlebtsov, 2014).  Other variables that could influence the uptake of a NP cargo include orientation, density and steric freedom of targeting ligands and surface groups (Cleal et al., 2013). Most NPs are first coated with serum proteins before they reach cell plasma membranes; endocytosis patterns of aggregated or agglomerated NPs differ from the one of individual NPs (Oh and Park, 2014).  Harush-Frenkel et al. compared the endocytosis into HeLa cells of NPs exposing either a negative or positive charge on their surface and found that the exposed charge significantly affected their ability to internalize as well as the cellular endocytosis mechanism utilized. Negatively charged NPs showed an inferior rate of endocytosis and did not utilize the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway, while positively charged NPs internalize rapidly primarily via clathrin-mediated pathways as well as macropinocytosis. When the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway is blocked positively charged NPs activate a compensatory endocytosis pathway that results in enhanced accumulation of NPs (Harush-Frenkel et al., 2007). In contrast, a higher uptake of negatively charged quantum dot NPs has been reported in HEK cells by Zhang and Monteiro-Riviere (2009).  Schuetz et al. demonstrated that positively charged SiNPs enter cells largely via dynamin 2-dependent caveolar internalization rather than clathrin-mediated endocytosis and accumulate in lysosomes (Schuetz et al., 2016).  Ng et al. have shown that the uptake of 20 nm size AuNPs in MRC5 lung fibroblasts and Chang liver cells was dependent upon clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Ng et al., 2014). Yang et al. studied the cellular uptake of ultra-small fluorescent gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) by HeLa cells and found that this energy-dependent process involved multiple mechanisms, with clathrin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis appearing to play a significant role, whereas the caveolin-mediated pathway contributing only to a lesser extent (Yang et al., 2013).&nbsp;  Gilleron et al. monitored the uptake of lipid NPs (LNPs) loaded with traceable siRNAs in different cell types in vitro and in mouse liver and found that LNPs enter cells by both constitutive and inducible pathways in a cell type-specific manner using clathrin-mediated endocytosis as well as macropinocytosis (Gilleron et al., 2013).  Saw et al. showed that the major uptake of confeito Au NP of 30 nm was both clathrin and caveolin mediated endocytosis, while for 60, 80 and 100 nm NP was via clathrin mediated pathway. Internalization by both clathrin and caveolin pathways explains higher cellular uptake of 30 nm Au NP compared to other ones (Saw et al., 2018). However, Brandenberger et al. showed that uptake of 30 nm citrate-cappedsphere Au NP was by a macroopinocytosis mechanism (Brandenberger et al., 2010).  It is obvious that not only size of NP, but also the surface property and shape are also important factors in the type of cellular uptake of NPs. As demonstrated earlier cationic NPs favor clathrin mediated endocytosis possibly due to electrostatic interaction with the cell surface receptors. However, not all the studies confirmed this preference of cationic NPs for clathrin mediated internalization. In contrast, caveolin mediated endocytosis occurs by interaction between hydrophobic group of NP with lipid raft on cell surface (Chakraborty and Jana, 2015). There is a connection between the endocytosis mechanism and the subcellular localization of the NPs. Clathrin mediated endocytosis leads to localization of NPs to the lysosome. Also, it has been found that if uptake of NPs occurs via both clathrin and lipid raft- mediated endocytosis, subcellular localization will also be mainly lysosomal. Caveolin mediated uptake of NPs is followed with formation of vesicles with neutral pH and transport to endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus or even nucleus (Rejman et al., 2005)"@en ;

  dc:description "This AOP delineates a sequence of key events initiating with stressor-induced activation of EGFR and resulting in decreased lung function through increased production of mucins. Excessive mucin production and consequent mucus hypersecretion are characteristic features of chronic diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, chronic bronchitis, and asthma, which pose a significant public health burden. Of note, exposure to cigarette smoke, occupational respiratory hazards, and air pollutants are clearly linked to the development of COPD, which is predicted to become the third leading cause of death worldwide by 2030 (Viegi et al., 2007, WHO, 2008). Mucus hypersecretion during the disease course can result in airway obstruction, decreased peak expiratory flow, respiratory muscle weakness, leading to decreased lung function (Kim and Criner, 2015, Yoshida and Tuder, 2007). Lung function decrease can have serious consequences and is associated with increased mortality (Panizza et al., 2006). This AOP is aimed to compile and organize the vast knowledge around molecular and cellular events and their relationships leading to lung function decrease with an overarching goal to facilitate the prediction and assessment of decreased pulmonary function. In vitro assays spanning from cell culture to organ system assays, with an aid of in silico methodology, all performed in human context, could be applied to measure each KE for inhaled toxicant assessments and adverse outcome predictions, and would contribute to eventual replacement of in-vivo tests in animals. This concept of hazard assessment and AO prediction aligns with integrated approach to testing and assessment (IATA) framework as a mechanistic support for regulatory decision-making (Clippinger et al., 2018).&nbsp;"@en ;

  dc:description "EGFR activation in lung epithelial cells can be triggered by exposure to H2O2 (Goldkorn et al., 1998; Takeyama&nbsp;et al., 2000), naphthalene (Van Winkle et al., 1997), cigarette smoke (Takeyama&nbsp;et al., 2001; de Boer et al., 2006; Marinaş et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2015), acrolein (Deshmukh et al., 2008),&nbsp;and TCDD (Lee et al., 2011). Mechanistically, this process is dependent on ROS-mediated activation of metalloproteinases or ADAMs which cleave membrane-bound EGFR ligand precursors, making them locally available to bind to and transactivate EGFR in an autocrine manner (Deshmukh et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2004; Val et al., 2012; Yoshisue and Hasegawa, 2004). Furthermore, ligand binding to EGFR itself was shown to lead to H2O2 production, thereby facilitating receptor activation and downstream signaling (DeYulia et al., 2005; DeYulia&nbsp;and C&aacute;rcamo, 2005; Truong and Carroll, 2012)."@en ;

  dc:description "Established regulatory guideline studies for inhalation toxicity focus on evident clinical signs of systemic toxicity, including death, or organ-specific toxicity following acute and (sub)chronic exposure respectively. In toxicological and safety pharmacological studies with airborne test items targeting the airways or the lungs as a whole, lung function is a relevant endpoint for the characterization of potential adverse events (OECD, 2018a; Hoymann, 2012). Hence, the AO &ldquo;decreased lung function&rdquo; is relevant for regulatory decision-making in the context of (sub)chronic exposure (OECD, 2018b; OECD, 2018c).  Regulatory relevance of the AO &ldquo;decreased lung function&rdquo; is evident when looking at the increased risk of diseases in humans following inhalation exposure, and because of its links to other comorbidities and mortality.  To aid diagnosis and monitoring of fibrosis, current recommendations include both the recording of potential environmental and occupational exposures as well as an assessment of lung function (Baumgartner et al., 2000). The latter typically confirms decreased lung function as demonstrated by a loss of lung volume. As the disease progresses, dyspnea and lung function worsen, and the prognosis is directly linked to the decline in FVC (Meltzer and Noble, 2008).   Chronic exposure to cigarette smoke and other combustion-derived particles results in the development of COPD. COPD is diagnosed on the basis of spirometry results as laid out in the ATS/ERS Task Force documents on the standardization of lung function tests and their interpretation (Pellegrino et al., 2005; Culver et al., 2017, Graham et al., 2019). Rapid rates of decline in the lung function parameter FEV1 are linked to higher risk of exacerbations, increased hospitalization and early death (Wise et al., 2006; Celli, 2010). Reduced FEV1 also poses a risk for serious cardiovascular events and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease (Sin et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2015).  &nbsp;"@en ;

Originally, &quot;oxidative stress&quot; was proposed as the MIE for this AOP.&nbsp; Upon discussion with EAGMST, it was suggested to use a term that is more representative of the mechanism of action, hence &quot;peptide oxidation&quot; is proposed instead.&nbsp; All references to &quot;oxidative stress&quot; within this&nbsp;wiki are made within the context that localised conditions conducive to oxidative damage within the vascular endothelium would trigger the revised MIE, and are limited to the peptide targets named within the AOP; namely GSH, GTPCH1, AKT and eNOS&nbsp;(although other redox sensitive peptides&nbsp;are undoubtedly affected also).

  dc:description "Alkylating agents are prototypical DNA-reactive compounds and have been extensively studied for decades (reviewed in Beranek 1990). The chemicals can be direct-acting electrophiles, or can be converted from non-reactive substances to reactive metabolites via metabolism. A prototypical alkylating agent is N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (chemical formula C3H7N3O2) (ENU). ENU is rapidly absorbed following oral exposure and intraperitoneal injections and distributed widely across the tissues. ENU is unstable and readily reacts with somatic and germ cell DNA in mice, rats, flies and hamsters, to alkylate DNA. Very generally, mono-functional (referring to the transfer of a single alkyl group) alkylating agents include: 1.	Alkyl sulfates: e.g., diethyl (DES) and dimethyl sulfate (DMS);  2.	Alkyl alkanesulfonates: e.g., methyl (MMS) and ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS);  3.	Nitrosamides: e.g., methyl (MNU) and ethyl nitrosourea (ENU), methyl- (MNNG) and ethyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (ENNG), and the indirect-acting (i.e., requiring metabolic activation) dimethyl (DMN) and diethyl nitrosamines (DEN).  ENU is the most widely studied and understood alkylating agent and as such has been instrumental in contributing to the knowledgebase in this field. Immunohistochemistry studies clearly indicate the presence of alkylated DNA following exposure to ENU in both somatic cells and spermatogonia (Kamino et al. 1995; Seiler et al. 1997; van Zeeland et al. 1990)."@en ;

  dc:description "De novo germ cell mutations are changes in the DNA sequence of sperm or egg that can be inherited by offspring. De novo mutations contribute to a wide range of human disorders including cancer, infertility, autism, schizophrenia, intellectual disability, and epilepsy (Girirajan et al. 2010; Hoischen et al. 2010; Ku et al. 2012; Lupski 2010; Morrow 2010; Vissers et al. 2010). Each child inherits, on average, approximately one de novo mutation per 100 million nucleotides delivered via the parental egg and sperm (Conrad et al. 2011; Kong et al. 2012; O&#39;Roak et al. 2012; Roach et al. 2010). The precise locations and types of mutations in the genomic DNA sequence govern the outcome of these mutations (e.g., protein coding versus intergenic sequences, conserved versus non-conserved mutations, etc.). Although a large portion of human DNA is of unknown function, recent literature suggests that at least 80% of the genome is transcribed, and most DNA is expected to have a biological function (Bernstein et al. 2012). It has been estimated that the proportion of coding and splice-site base substitutions that result in truncating mutations is ~5% (Kryukov et al. 2007), and that as many as 30% of missense mutations are also likely to be highly deleterious due to loss of function (Boyko et al. 2008). When they occur in functional sites, de novo mutations can cause embryonic or fetal lethality, or if viable, can produce a broad spectrum of inherited genetic disorders. Recent estimates suggest that a human genome contains approximately 100 loss-of-function variants, with as many as 20 exhibiting complete loss of gene function (McLaughlin et al. 2010). Therefore, de novo mutations contribute to the overall population genetic disease burden. The present AOP focuses on DNA alkylation in spermatogonia that causes inherited mutation transmitted via sperm, arguably one of the most well characterized modes of action in genetic toxicology. Humans are exposed to alkylating agents from external (e.g., abiotic plant materials, tobacco smoke, combustion products, chemotherapeutic agents) and internal (e.g., byproducts of oxidative damage and cellular methyl donors) sources."@en ;

  dc:description "Heritable mutations are an important regulatory endpoint for most agencies around the world (reviewed in Yauk et al. 2015). Strategies and guidelines for regulatory toxicology testing in various national regulatory jurisdictions, including requirements for germ cell mutation assays, have been described extensively by Cimino (2006), and have not changed significantly. While no jurisdiction requires germ cell testing per se in an initial test battery, many regulatory authorities can request germ cell tests for follow-up studies, e.g. in the U.S.A (U.S. EPA), Canada (Health Canada), the United Kingdom (Committee on Mutagenicity: COM), and Europe (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals, i.e. REACH). For example, within the REACH strategy a substance that is genotoxic in somatic cells is evaluated from the literature to see if it is a potential germ cell mutagen based on bioavailability to the germ cells and appropriate in vivo data. If such an evaluation shows that the literature is insufficient to determine whether the agent is or is not a potential germ cell mutagen, then that agent can be tested in a suitable germ cell genotoxicity assay. Although germ cell testing is not specifically required under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA) New Substances Notification Regulations, germ cell mutation tests are requested and evaluated when necessary. For new chemical assessments under CEPA from 1994 to 2012, a total of 19 chemicals have been evaluated for germ cell mutagenicity (12 for which the test was submitted, plus 7 for which the test was referenced on the MSDS); importantly, this is comparable to the number for which testing in rodent cancer assays was evaluated (i.e. total of 20; 17 for which the test was submitted, plus 3 for which test was referenced on the MSDS) (Personal Communication, New Substances Assessment and Control Bureau, Health Canada).  These examples illustrates the regulatory importance of heritable mutations as an adverse outcome. For pharmaceuticals, the ICH Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use does not require germ cell tests and assumes that in vivo somatic tests and carcinogenicity data will provide sufficient predictivity/protection for germ cell effects (ICH, 2011) The World Health Organization (WHO)/International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS) has developed a harmonized scheme for mutagenicity testing. In this document the relationship between somatic cell mutagenicity and germ cell risk is summarized in the following statement. “For substances that give positive results for mutagenic effects in somatic cells in vivo, their potential to affect germ cells should be considered. If there is toxicokinetic or toxicodynamic evidence that germ cells are actually exposed to the somatic mutagen or its bioactive metabolites, it is reasonable to assume that the substance may also pose a mutagenic hazard to germ cells and thus a risk to future generations.” (Eastmond et al. 2009). The Global Harmonization Scheme (GHS; UN, 2013) is a germ cell mutation classification system developed by the United Nations that identifies them according to the categories noted in the Table below. To date over 60 countries have implemented this programme, and are in the process of integrating it into their relevant regulations.  To date its implementation is focussed on product labelling legislation in the respective countries and regulatory jurisdictions. Categorization of mutagens by GHS Category	Description 1A	        Chemicals known to induce heritable mutations in germ cells of humans 1B	        Chemicals that should be regarded as if they induce heritable mutations in germ cells of humans 2	        Chemicals that cause concern for induction of heritable mutations in germ cells of humans Finally, we note that mouse data obtained with the specific locus test and other recessive mutation analyses played an important role in estimating radiation dose risk in the human population (BEIR VII 2006)."@en ;

  dc:description "In 1957, millions of broiler chickens died due to a mysterious chick edema disease characterized by pericardial, subcutaneous and peritoneal edema (SCHMITTLE et al. 1958). This disease was later ascribed to the ingestion of feed contaminated with halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (HAHs), including 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) (Higginbotham et al. 1968; Metcalfe 1972). It has since become evident that TCDD is a prototypical agonist of the AHR: a transcription factor that modulates the expression of a vast array of genes involved in endogenous development and physiological responses to exogenous chemicals (Denison et al. 2011).&nbsp; A general study in the 1980&rsquo;s found that mothers exposed to herbicides during pregnancy had a 2.8-fold increase in risk of having a baby with congenital cardiovascular malformations (Loffredo et al. 2001). Epidemiological studies have correlated long-term TCDD exposure with ischemic heart disease (Bertazzi et al. 1998; Flesch-Janys et al. 1995); interestingly, and consistent with this AOP, sectioned and stained heart samples from patients with this disease lack epicardial cells (Di et al. 2010). Mammalian studies have confirmed that in utero exposure to TCDD increases susceptibility to cardiovascular dysfunction in adulthood (Aragon et al. 2008; Thackaberry et al. 2005b). The developing heart is highly dependent on oxygen saturation levels; somewhat counterintuitively, a state of hypoxia (relative to adult oxygen tension) drives normal formation and maturation. Deviation from this optimal oxygen level, either above or below normal, hinders myocardial and endothelial development, altering coronary artery connections, ventricle wall thickness and chamber formation (Patterson and Zhang 2010; Wikenheiser et al. 2009). Interestingly, AHR activation (by TCDD), inhibition, and knockdown significantly inhibited the formation of contractile cardiomyocyte nodes during spontaneous differentiation of embryonic stem cells into cardiomyocytes (in vitro) (Wang et al. 2013), indicating that AHR also has an optimal window of expression for normal cardiogenesis. TCDD significantly reduces the degree of myocardial hypoxia that normally occurs during myocyte proliferation and ventricular wall thickening in the developing embryo (Ivnitski-Steele et al. 2004; Lee et al. 2001). This reduction in hypoxia is associated with reduced expression of both HIF-1and the VEGF splice variant, VEGF166 mRNA, which is one of the primary VEGF variants required to mediate coronary vascularization (Ivnitski-Steele et al. 2004). Therefore, it is biologically plausible that sustained AHR activation sequesters ARNT from HIF-1&alpha; impairing hypoxia stimulated coronary angiogenesis."@en ;

  dc:description "The AHR can be activated by several structurally diverse chemicals, but binds preferentially to planar halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Dioxin-like compounds (DLCs), which include polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and certain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), are among the most potent AHR ligands[38]. Only a subset of PCDD, PCDF and PCB congeners has been shown to bind to the AHR and cause toxic effects to those elicited by TCDD. Until recently, TCDD was considered to be the most potent DLC in birds[39]; however, recent reports indicate that 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (PeCDF) is more potent than TCDD in some species of birds.[40][13][41][21][42][43] When screened for their ability to induce aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) activity, dioxins with chlorine atoms at a minimum of three out of the four lateral ring positions, and with at least one non-chlorinated ring position are the most active[44]. Of the dioxin-like PCBs, non-ortho congeners are the most toxicologically active, while mono-ortho PCBs are generally less potent[45][9]. Chlorine substitution at ortho positions increases the energetic costs of assuming the coplanar conformation required for binding to the AHR [45]. Thus, a smaller proportion of mono-ortho PCB molecules are able to bind to the AHR and elicit toxic effects, resulting in reduced potency of these congeners. Other PCB congeners, such as di-ortho substituted PCBs, are very weak AHR agonists and do not likely contribute to dioxin-like effects [9].   	Contrary to studies of birds and mammals, even the most potent mono-ortho PCBs bind to AhRs of fishes with very low affinity, if at all (Abnet et al 1999; Doering et al 2014; 2015; Eisner et al 2016; Van den Berg et al 1998).   The role of the AHR in mediating the toxic effects of planar hydrophobic contaminants has been well studied, however the endogenous role of the AHR is less clear [1]. Some endogenous and natural substances, including prostaglandin PGG2 and the tryptophan derivatives indole-3-carbinol, 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ) and kynurenic acid can bind to and activate the AHR. [6][46][47][48][49] The AHR is thought to have important endogenous roles in reproduction, liver and heart development, cardiovascular function, immune function and cell cycle regulation [50][38][51][52][53][54][46][55][56][57] and activation of the AHR by DLCs may therefore adversely affect these processes."@en ;

  dc:description "Transthyretin is one of three ancient, highly conserved serum binding proteins&nbsp;that collectively act to transport thyroid hormone (TH) and thus help maintain normal homeostasis via modulation of the hypothalamic/pituitary/thyroid axis. In addition to TTR, albumin (ALB) and thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) also serve to transport TH in serum and the relative contribution of each binding protein differs across species. In man, TBG has the greatest affinity for thyroxine (T4), followed by TTR and ALB shows the lowest affinity for T4 while prevalence in serum is the opposite, while in rat, TTR is the major serum transport protein (as rats lack TBG). Interference with TH serum binding proteins is one of several mechanisms through which xenobiotics and environmental contaminants can disrupt normal thyroid endocrine function (&quot;thyroid disruptors&quot;) and development of this AOP is expected to contribute towards a fuller understanding of the mechanism of TTR interference and how it may be measured in vitro as part of a larger screening battery for thyroid toxicants."@en ;

  dc:description "The ICH S8 guideline, which covers immunosuppression of small molecule drugs, determines the need for immunotoxicity studies by comprehensively evaluating the findings of pharmacology, changes in the immune system in repeated-dose toxicity studies, and other factors using a Weight of Evidence approach. If there is concern about immunotoxicity, the presence or absence of immunotoxicity should be determined using an in vivo test system capable of assessing the functional changes of predicted immunotoxic target cells. If immunotoxicity is observed, additional studies including in vitro assays or clinical evaluation should be considered to assess the risk of immunotoxicity in humans. Because TDAR involves many immune cell populations, including T cells, B cells, and antigen-presenting cells, evaluation of TDAR is recommended when there is concern about immunotoxicity but the immunotoxic target cells are unclear. The S8 guidelines list KLH, SRBC, and tetanus toxin as antigens for TDAR.  The draft FDA immunotoxicity testing guidance (2020) covers immunosuppressive and immunostimulatory drugs and biologics; evaluating immunosuppressive drugs in the draft FDA guidance is similar to that in the S8 guideline, with in vivo TDAR assays recommended when toxic target cells are unknown. The draft guidance states that TDAR assays using KLH as an antigen have been established in mice, rats, dogs, minipigs, and cynomolgus monkeys, but the use of SRBC and tetanus toxin as antigens is also acceptable.  For the assessment for pesticides, US EPA OPPTS 870.7800 immunotoxicity testing guideline recommends TDAR using SRBC. The REACH guideline does not provide for immunotoxicity testing, but it provides triggers for conducting immunotoxicity testing.  The WHO/IPSS Immunotoxicity Risk assessment Guidance (2012) describes a strategy for assessing five categories of immunotoxicity risks, including immunosuppression. For risk assessment of immunosuppression, it calls for identification of immunosuppression risks, prediction of pathogenesis that may occur, and consideration of safety margins based on the WoE approach from human findings, infection resistance tests, immune function tests, general immune system assays, histopathological findings and organ weights in general toxicity studies, and hematological data.  The evaluation of immunotoxicity in F1 animals in the OECD Guidelines for Extended First Generation Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity Studies (TG443) requires that PFC and ELSA assays to measure primary IgM antibody production by TDAR using T-cell dependent antigens (SRBC, KLH, etc.) be performed. Furthermore, if changes are observed, the significance of the changes should be examined by comprehensively evaluating other data.  The outcomes of immunosuppression are susceptibility to infection and tumorigenesis, and the FDA guidance requires that immunosuppressive drugs be evaluated for carcinogenic risk using WoE approach based on the results of carcinogenicity and immunotoxicity studies. Meanwhile, the ICH S1B(R1) Draft Step 2 Guidelines for Carcinogenicity Testing calls for evaluation of carcinogenicity by WoE approach instead of rat carcinogenicity testing, because rodent carcinogenicity test models are less capable of detecting carcinogenicity. On the other hand, it is difficult to define susceptibility to infection as a measurable AO with a clear mechanism, because immune responses vary among pathogens. In fact, many immunotoxicity guidelines require that the risk of immunotoxicity be identified and assessed by evaluating immune functions.  It was difficult to define susceptibility to infection as an AO, so TDAR, which is recommended as an indicator of immunosuppresoin in many guidelines, was used as an AO. It is expected that several AOPs with TDARs as AOs will be developed, and based on these AOPs, it may be possible to develop an IATA to assess the risk of immunotoxicity characterized by TDARs."@en ;

  dc:description "Propylthiouracil (PTU) is the prototypical DIO1 inhibitor in mammals, although teleostean and amphibian DIO1 enzymes are less sensitive to inhibition by PTU (Orozco et al., 2003; Kuiper et al., 2006). Olker et al. (2019) identified 22 DIO1-specific inhibitors using a human recombinant DIO1 enzyme (e.g., genistein, 6-methyl-2-thiouracil, sulfasalazine). Another well-known inhibitor of DIO1 (and DIO2 and 3) is iopanoic acid (IOP). Renko et al. (2003, 2015) pointed out that IOP is actually a substrate of DIO1 (and DIO2 and 3) which is in line with its action as a competitive inhibotor. In fact, many compounds inhibit all three DIO isoforms. Olker et al. (2019) identified 93 compounds that inhibit DIOs 1, 2 and 3."@en ;

Putative adverse outcome pathways relevant to neurotoxicity. Crit Rev Toxicol 45(1), 83-91.  The process of inflammation is common to many tissues and can be described by several KEs, as proposed in a dedicated workshop (Villeneuve et al., 2018). Brain inflammation called Neuroinflammation can be described by the two common KEs: Tissue resident cell, activation and pro-inflammatory mediators, increased. However, Neuroinflammation is a concept accepted by the regulators and is found in the whole literature describing brain inflammation. Therefore, in accord with the external reviewers, we decided to use the KE Neuroinflammation &nbsp;for building the KERs of this AOP, but we introduced in the list of the KEs the two KEs common to the inflammatory process, as proposed in Villeneuve et al., 2018."@en ;

  dc:description "Mercury (Methylmercury, mercury chloride)  The binding of Methylmercury (MeHg) to redox sensitive thiol- or selenol-groups can disrupt the activity of enzymes or the biochemical role of non-enzymatic proteins. The stable or transitory interaction (binding) of MeHg with critical thiol and selenol groups in target enzymes can disrupt the biological function of different types of enzymes, particularly of the antioxidant selenoenzymes thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and glutathione peroxidase isoforms. The dysregulation of cerebral glutathione (GSH and GSSG) and thioredoxin [Trx or Trx(SH)2] &nbsp;systems by MeHg (Farina et al. 2011; Branco et al. 2017) can impair the fine cellular redox balance via disruption of sensitive cysteinyl- or thiol-containing proteins (Go etal., 2013; Go et al. 2014; Jones 2015).   &nbsp;    Figure 1 &ndash; Hypothetical Binding of MeHg to different types of target proteins. The binding of MeHg to proteins can cause either a transitory inhibition of the protein fucntion (first line, the yellow protein was reactivated by interacting with LMM-SH or R-SH). The pink protein is an example of protein that after the binding of MeHg suffered a change in the structure in such a way that it cannot be reactivated by LMM-SH or R-SH.&nbsp; The third protein (blue) is an example of protein that was permanently denaturated after MeHg binding and even after the removal of MeHg the activity was not recovered. The same type of interactions can be applied to the selenol-containing proteins (i.e., the selenoproteins).  The affinity of Mercury chloride (Hg2+) for thiol and selenol groups is higher than that of MeHg (compare Table 2 with Table 1). The constants described in Table 1 and 2 indicate that MeHg and Hg2+ behave as&nbsp; strong soft electrophiles, i.e., theyhave much higher affinity for the soft nucleophiles centers of thiol- and selenol-containing molecules (Rabenstein 1978a; Arnold et al. 1986; Sugiura et al., 1976).Furthermore, the rate constant for the reaction of MeHg with thiol/thiolate (R-SH/R-S-) has been estimated to be about 6 x 108 M-1.sec-1,&nbsp; indicating that the reactions of electrophilic forms of Hg (EpHg+&nbsp;; here MeHg and Hg2+) with thiolate and selenolate groups are diffusion controlled reactions (Rabenstein&nbsp; and Fairhurst, 1975). The constant indicates that the binding of EpHg+ to thiolate (-S-) or selenolate (-Se-) groups will occurr almost instaneously, when an EpHg+ collides with &ndash;S- or -Se- groups.  The studies of Rabenstein and others have also pointed out that the affinity of MeHg for &ndash;SeH groups is higher than for&nbsp; &ndash;SH groups (Sugira et al. 1976; Arnold et al. 1986). Consequently, &ndash;SeH-containing molecules (i.e., selenoproteins) should be the preferential targets for MeHg (Farina et al. 2011). Accordingly, several studies have demonstrate that the selenoenzymes glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) were inhibited after in vitro and in vivo exposure to MeHg&nbsp; or Hg2+ (Carvalho et al., 2008a; 2011, Farina et al.,&nbsp; 2009; Franco et al., 2009; Wagner et al., 2010; Branco et al., 2011; 2012; 2014, 2017; Dalla Corte et al., 2013; Meinerz et al., 2017).  As corollary, the occurrence of free MeHg and Hg2+ or bound to other ligands such as carboxylates, amines, chloride or hydroxyl anions in the physiological media of living cells is insignificant or nonexistent (George et al. 2008). The binding of MeHg to abundant low molecular mass thiols or LMM-SH (e.g., cysteine and reduced glutathione-GSH) and high molecular mass thiol-containing proteins or HMM-SH (e.g., albumin, hemoglobin, etc) is critical for the MeHg distribution from non-target to target organs and cells (Farina et al. 2017). The coordination of MeHg with one &ndash;S- group of a LMM-SH will determine MeHg distribution to its targets organs, including the brain. The coordination of Hg2+ with two &ndash;S- of LMM-SH molecules (particularly, cysteine or Cys) will determine the distribution of Hg2+ to kidney (which is its main target) and to non-classical targets organs, such as the brain (Oliveira et al. 2017). The entrance of Hg2+ into the brain is proportionally small, but recent literature data have indicated the neurotoxicity of very low and environmentally relevant doses of Hg2+ in rodents (Mello-Carpes et al. 2013&nbsp;), which confirms data obtained with toxic doses in rodents (Peixoto et al. 2007&nbsp;;&nbsp; Franciscato et al. 2009&nbsp;; Chehimi et al. 2012).

We have to emphasize that what we call of binding to &ndash;SH or &ndash;SeH groups is, in fact, an exchange reaction of MeHg from MeHg-S conjugates (e.g., MeHg-cysteine or MeHg-Cys and MeHg-glutathione or MeHg-SG. conjugates) to&nbsp; a free thiol/thiolate- or selenol/selenolate-group from non-target or target proteins. Thus, the interaction of MeHg with its target proteins in the brain usually involves the exchange of MeHg from low-molecular mass conjugates (LMM-S-conjugates) to a thiol or selenol group in different types of proteins (Rabenstein 1978b; Rabenstein and Fairhurst, 1975; Reid and Rabenstein et al.; 1982; Rabenstein and Reid, 1984; Arnold et al. 1986; Farina et al. 2011, 2017; D&oacute;rea et al. 2013).     Figure 2 &ndash; Binding of MeHg (CH3Hg+) to target thiol- (HMM-SH) or selenol-containing proteins (HMM-SeH). Note that, in fact, the binding of MeHg to their high molecular mass target proteins is mediated by exchange reactions of MeHg from low molecular mass thiol (LMM-SH) molecules to HMM-SH (represented by Prot-SH) or HMM-SeH (represented by Prot-SeH). The scheme also demonstrated that MeHg conjugated with one LMM-SH (here represented by either Cys1-SHgCH3 or G1SHgCH3) can exchange with others LMM-SH (here represented by Cys2-SH or G2SH). After one exchange reaction, the conjugated Cys1-SHgCH3 and G1SHgCH3 release the free LMM-SH molecules Cys1-SH or G1SH.  &nbsp;  Table 3: References for the inhibition by MeHg and Hg2+ of SH-/seleno-proteins involved in protection against oxidative stress   	 		 			 			Protein activity inhibited by MeHg 			 			 			Exposure 			 			 			Functional group likely involved in the inhibition 			 			 			Organism-preparation 			 			 			&nbsp; 			 		 		 			 			Glutathione peroxidase (total GPx) 			 			 			in vivo 			 			 			-SeH 			 			 			Adult mice 			 			 			Glasser et al. 2013 			 		 		 			 			Total GPx 			 			 			in vivo 			 			 			-SeH 			 			 			Adult mice 			 			 			Glasser et al. 2010a 			 		 		 			 			Mitochondrial total GPx 			 			 			in vivo 			 			 			-SeH 			 			 			Adult mice 			 			 			Franco et al. 2009 			 		 		 			 			Total GPx 			 			 			in vitro 			 			 			-SeH 			 			 			SH-SY5Y cells 			 			 			Franco et al. 2009 			 		 		 			 			GPx1 and GPx4 			 			 			in vivo 			 			 			-SeH 			 			 			Adult mice 			 			 			Zemolin et al. 2012 			 		 		 			 			Total GPx 			 			 			in vivo 			 			 			-SeH 			 			 			Adult male mice 			 			 			Malagutti et al. 2009 			 		 		 			 			Total GPx 			 			 			in vitro 			 			 			-SeH 			 			 			PC12 cells 			 			 			Li et al. 2008 			 		 		 			 			Total GPx 			 			 			in vivo 			 			 			-SeH 			 			 			Mice gestational exposure 			 			 			Stringari et al. 2008 			 		 		 			 			Total GPx 			 			 			in vivo 			 			 			-SeH 			 			 			Adult rats 			 			 			Cheng et al. 2005 			 		 		 			 			Total GPx 			 			 			in vitro 			 			 			-SeH 			 			 			Fetal Telencepalic cells from rats 			 			 			Sorg et al. 1998 			 		 		 			 			Total GPx 			 			 			in vitro 			 			 			-SeH 			 			 			Mice neuroblastoma cells 			 			 			Kromidas et al. 1990 			 		 		 			 			Thioredoxin Reductase (TrxR) 			 			 			in vivo 			 			 			-SeH&nbsp; and &ndash;SH 			 			 			Adult mice 			 			 			Zemolin et al. 2012 			 		 		 			 			TrxR 			 			 			in vitro 			 			 			-SeH&nbsp; and &ndash;SH 			 			 			Adult mice 			 			 			Wagner et al. 2010 			 		 		 			 			TrxR 			 			 			in vivo 			 			 			-SeH-&nbsp; and &ndash;SH 			 			 			Adult rats 			 			 			Dalla Corte et al. 2013 			 		 		 			 			Mitochondrial total Gpx 			 			 			In vivo 			 			 			-SeH 			 			 			Adult rat 			 			 			Mori et al., 2007 			 		 		 			 			Mitochondrial total Gpx 			 			 			In vivo 			 			 			-SeH 			 			 			Adult Swiss male mice brain 			 			 			Franco et al., 2009 			 		 		 			&nbsp; 			&nbsp; 			&nbsp; 			&nbsp; 			&nbsp; 		 		 			 			Total brain TrxR 			 			 			In vivo 			 			 			-SeH and -SH 			 			 			Juvenile fish (zebra-seabreams) 			 			 			Branco et al. 2011  			Branco et al. 2012a,b 			 		 		 			&nbsp; 			&nbsp; 			&nbsp; 			&nbsp; 			&nbsp; 		 		 			 			Protein activity inhibited by Hg2+ 			 			 			&nbsp;  			exposure 			 			 			Functional group likely involved in the inhibition 			 			 			&nbsp;  			organism-preparation 			 			 			&nbsp; 			 		 		 			 			Total brain TrxR 			 			 			In vivo 			 			 			-SeH and -SH 			 			 			Juvenile fish (zebra-seabreams) 			 			 			Branco et al. 2012a,b 			 		 	   &nbsp;  Acrylamide   Acrylamide is an a,&beta;-unsaturated (conjugated) reactive molecule, which can react with thiol (-SH) and amino (-NH2) groups in proteins&nbsp; (LoPachin, 2004; LoPachin et al. 2007; 2009; 2011;&nbsp; Friedman, 2003; Bent et al. 2016; Martyniuk et al.2011; LoPachin and Gavin, 2014 ). However, the rate constant for the reaction between acrylamide with thiol/thiolate groups is much lower than that for MeHg.&nbsp; The rate of reaction of this compound with HMM-SH and LMM-SH is slow but can occur under physiological conditions (Tong et al. 2004; LoPachin, 2004). The inhibition of brain enzymes by acrylamide have been studied and the inhibition caused by acrylamide in some HMM-SH can be reversible&nbsp; (Howland et al. 1980). Despite of this, we can infer that some targets of MeHg and acrylamide can overlap, in particular GSH,where the rate constant for MeHg and acrylamide are &asymp;6.0 x 108 M-1.sec-1 and &asymp;0.15-2.1 x 10-2 M-1.sec-1, respectively (Yousef and Demerdash, 2006; Lapadula et al. 1989; Kopańska et al. 2015). Acrylamide can also be metabolized to an epoxide intermediate (glycidamide), which can also form adducts with cysteinyl residues in HMM-SH target proteins (Bergmark et al. 1991).  &nbsp;"@en ;

Most methods are well established in the published literature and many have been engaged to evaluate the effects of developmental thyroid disruption. The US EPA and OECD Developmental Neurotoxicity (DNT) Guidelines (OCSPP 870.6300 or OECD TG 426) as well as OECD TG 443 (OECD, 2018) both require testing of learning and memory (USEPA, 1998; OECD, 2007) advising to use the following tests passive avoidance, delayed-matching-to-position for the adult rat and for the infant rat, olfactory conditioning, Morris water maze, Biel or Cincinnati maze, radial arm maze, T-maze, and acquisition and retention of schedule-controlled behavior. These DNT Guidelines have been deemed valid to identify developmental neurotoxicity and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes (Makris et al., 2009).&nbsp;  Also, in the frame of the OECD GD 43 (2008) on reproductive toxicity, learning and memory testing may have potential to be applied in the context of developmental neurotoxicity studies.

  dc:description "There is a high potential for inhalation exposure to toxicants in various occupational settings and polluted environments. Extensive investigation of pulmonary toxicity following inhalation of chemical and particulate stressors have demonstrated that these toxicants mount an exuberant inflammatory response early after exposure that, when unresolved, lays&nbsp;the foundation for later pathologies. Although inflammation is a normal immune reaction of the organism designed to effectively eliminate the invading threat, chronic and unresolved tissue inflammation is detrimental. Unresolved lung inflammation&nbsp;in humans plays a causative role in many debilitating and even lethal adverse health effects, such as decreased lung function, emphysema, fibrosis, and cancer. The various pathways, mechanisms, and biological processes associated with the pulmonary inflammatory process are well characterized in experimental animals and, to a great extent, in humans. Here, a mechanism underlying stressor-induced pulmonary&nbsp;fibrosis that involves a pro-inflammatory component is described.  Pulmonary fibrosis is a&nbsp;chronic lung pathology, which when not treated, results in&nbsp;lethality. It is&nbsp;characterized by the&nbsp;excessive&nbsp;extracellular matrix (ECM) and collagen&nbsp;deposition and&nbsp;restructuring. Numerous respiratory diseases, such as pneumoconiosis, silicosis, asbestosis, bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) (&lsquo;popcorn lung&rsquo;), and chronic beryllium disease have pulmonary fibrosis as a main or secondary symptom. In addition,&nbsp;exposure to pharmaceuticals and environmental contaminants such as bleomycin and arsenic via inhalation, oral or intravenous routes also induces the adverse otucome (AO)&nbsp;of pulmonary fibrosis.&nbsp;Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most common type of pulmonary fibrosis in humans and involves alveolar regions of the lung consisting of type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2s), type 1 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC1s) and mesenchymal cells. AEC1s are responsible for gas exchange and AEC2s synthesise surfactant. The AEC2s are capable of self-renewal and differentiate to AEC1s regularly during normal tissue maintenance (Barkauskas and&nbsp;Noble, 2014). In pro-fibrotic conditions, AEC2s fail to regenerate AEC1s lost by injury and do not respond normally to epithelial injury, undergoing hyperplasia. As a result, human patients suffering from IPF have dysregulated levels of surfactant proteins normally secreted by AEC2s (Barlo et al.,2009; Phelps et al., 2004).&nbsp;Genetic studies have associated mutations in genes encoding surfactant proteins and the development of a familial type of lung fibrosis. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining of human IPF lung slices shows AEC death as well as proliferation adjacent to fibrotic foci (Uhal et al., 1998). AEC2s are hyperplastic and are located on top of the fibrotic lesions in the lung in human specimens (Katzenstein and&nbsp;Myers, 1998).&nbsp;In animal models of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis, abnormal AEC2s are incapable of protecting the basement membrane&nbsp;destroyed by cell death, leading to aberrant repair and deposition of&nbsp;ECM,&nbsp;resulting in fibrosis (Rock et al., 2011). Targeted removal of AEC2s in mouse lungs results in full&nbsp;manifestion of the&nbsp;fibrotic disease (Sisson et al., 2010). In certain infectious conditions, epithelial cell stress and dysfunction leading to inefficient repair capacity or transcriptional reprogramming of epithelial cells to secrete pro-fibrotic and pro-inflammatory factors&nbsp;leads to lung fibrosis (Lawson et al., 2008; Lawson et al., 2011). Mesenchymal cells are the other main type of cell, which contribute to fibrosis development. The dysregulated proliferation of fibroblasts and myofibroblast differentiation leading to excessive ECM deposition in the fibrotic scar is the result of disrupted cross-talk between epithelial and mesenchymal cells (Barkauskas and&nbsp;Noble&nbsp;2014). Myofibroblasts exhibiting contractile properties of smooth muscle cells and expressing Alpha-smooth muscle actin (&alpha;-SMA) and vimentin, are the types of mesenchymal cells that are most commonly associated with excessive collagen secretion in pro-fibrotic phenotypes (Todd et al., 2012). Myofibroblasts can arise mainly from differentiation of tissue resident fibroblasts, translocation of bone marrow (BM) derived fibrocytes into the lung, or from epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation (EMT; a type of trans-differentiation) (Hung, 2020; Todd et al., 2012). These cells are critical to the normal process of wound healing, and are the main cells contributing to collagen deposition in both normal wear-and-tear repair processes and in disease promoting conditions. Following successful wound healing, myofibroblasts de-differentiate and disappear (Friedman, 2012). Myofibroblasts persistence is suggested to play a key role in progressive pulmonary fibrosis in humans. There is evidence for both EMT derived myofibroblasts and BM&nbsp;derived fibrocytes in human pulmonary fibrotic conditions. Air epithelial biopsies from human patients suffering from BO&nbsp;following lung transplant show significantly increased staining for mesenchymal markers (Vimentin and &alpha;-SMA), decreased staining for e-cadherin, and co-localization of epithelial and mesenchymal markers as compared to stable patients (Borthwick et al., 2009). With respect to BM&nbsp;derived fibrocytes, these cells have been proposed as an indicator for poor prognosis in human IPF patients, and research has shown that the amount of fibrocytes in the human IPF lung correlates with the amount of fibroblastic foci (Andersson-Sj&ouml;land et al., 2008; Moeller et al., 2009). Additional cell types involved in fibrotic process include endothelial cells and immune cells such as macrophages, neutrophils, and T helper (Th) cells. Endothelial cells contribute to the fibrotic process through EMT, as evidenced in bleomycin model systems in which endothelial cells in fibrotic conditions take on the characteristics of myofibroblasts (Kato et al., 2018). Macrophages present in the alveolar space as well as macrophages recruited to the lung during the fibrotic process also contribute to the inflammatory environment and potentiate the AO&nbsp;of pulmonary fibrosis. Direct interaction of fibrotic stressors, such as multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), silica, and asbestos, with the macrophage cell membrane can occur through scavenger receptors as well as through receptors such as Macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO) (Li and&nbsp;Cao, 2018; Murphy et al., 2015). This can induce macrophage cell&nbsp;injury through frustrated or incomplete phagocytosis which leads to the production of alarmins such as Interleukin (IL)-1&beta;&nbsp;and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and profibrotic mediators such as Tumour&nbsp;necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&alpha;), Transforming growth factor beta&nbsp;(TGF-&beta;), and Platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) (Dong and&nbsp;Ma, 2016; Li and&nbsp;Cao, 2018). The injured resident macrophages contribute to the initial acute phase pro-inflammatory response leading to recruitment&nbsp;of additional immune cells to the lung. Depending on the fibrotic stressor, different populations of immune cells can be initially recruited to the site of action. The recruitment of neutrophils into the lung space potentiates the inflammatory response and tissue damage. Furthermore, in conditions of acute lung injury, which can precede the development of a fibrotic phenotype, neutrophil&nbsp;recruitment to the lung through trans-epithelial migration can induce the formation of lesions in the epithelium and contribute to the loss of alveolar capillary membrane (ACM) integrity (Zemans et al., 2009). Finally, Th&nbsp;cells recruited to the lung potentiate the inflammatory environment, and through the induction of a Th type 2 (Th2)&nbsp;response, stimulate the proliferation of fibroblasts and differentiation of myofibroblasts driving the development of a fibrotic phenotype (Shao et al., 2008; Wynn, 2004).   Although this AOP is applicable to a broad group of stressors, the AOP was specifically assembled keeping in mind, a novel class of engineered nanomaterials (NMs) exhibiting sophisticated properties that have been shown to induce lung fibrosis via this mechanism. Specifically, nanomaterial properties such as aspect ratio, tube/fiber rigidity, crystallinity and persistence are suggested to play a role in the induction of pulmonary fibrosis. Thus, it demonstrates the applicability of the AOP framework to nanotoxicology.  Given the fundamental role of inflammation in organ homeostasis, well characterized AOPs targeting the pathological outcomes of unregulated inflammatory responses are important and will guide the development of appropriate assays to measure the key events that are predictive of inflammation-mediated chronic health impacts, and aid in screening a large array of inhalation toxicants that are inflammogenic, for their potential to induce lung diseases."@en ;

  dc:description "As stated earlier, there are many different ways by which pro-fibrotic stressors can interact with the components of cell membrane and often involve multiple interactions at the same time. Few studies investigate the exact interaction between the stressor and the cellular membrane components. Asbestos and silica crystals engage scavenger receptors present on the macrophages (Murthy et al., 2015). Bleomycin binds high affinity bleomycin binding sites present on rat alveolar macrophage surfaces, leading to macrophage activation (Denholm and Phan, 1990). However, the consequences of such interactions such as, the release of PRR agonists DAMPs (alarmins) from dying or injured cells, increased&nbsp; gene or protein synthesis downstream of receptor binding or in the case of NMs, their cellular uptake, are measured routinely as indicative of occurrence of such interactions (Nel et al., 2009; Cheng et al., 2013). Because of the phys-chem properties such as surface charge, NMs and asbestos like materials can bind to cellular macromolecules and cell surface/membrane components, which in turn, facilitate their uptake and intracellular sequestration by the cells (NIOSH, 2011a; Pascolo et al., 2013). Several DAMPs that can be effectively measured in biological samples and cultured cells include High Mobility Group Binding 1 (HMGB1) protein, Heat Shock proteins (HSPs), uric acid, annexins, and S100 proteins (Bianchi, 2007). Of all DAMPs, interleukin (IL)-1&alpha; is the most commonly measured alarmin. IL-1&alpha; is the principal pro-inflammatory moiety and is a designated &lsquo;alarmin&rsquo; in the cell that alerts the host to injury or damage (Di Paolo and Shayakhmetov, 2016). It is shown that administration of necrotic cells to mice results in neutrophilic inflammation that was entirely mediated by IL-1&alpha; released from the dying or necrosed cells and consequent activation of IL-1 Receptor 1 (IL-1R1) signalling (Suwara et al., 2014). IL-1&alpha; is released following exposure to MWCNTs (Nikota et al., 2017) and silica (Rabolli et al., 2014). Although IL1-b is not a designated alarmin, its secretion following exposure to stressors is routinely assessed and is linked to initiation of cell or tissue injury.  Other high aspect ratio fibres such as asbestos and CNTs induce frustrated phagocytosis and acute cell injury (Boyles et al., 2015; D&ouml;rger et al., 2001; Brown et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2010; Poland et al., 2008), leading to DAMP release (Nikota et al, 2017), inflammation and immune responses."@en ;

  dc:description "Thyroid Disrupting Chemicals (TDCs) are defined as the xenobiotics that interfere with the thyroid axis with different outcomes for the organism. A very well-studied mechanism of action of the TDCs is the reduction of the circulating levels of THs by inhibiting hormone synthesis in the thyroid gland. For example, perchlorate is a very potent inhibitor of iodide uptake through the sodium/iodide symporter (Tonacchera et al., 2004). Perchlorate has been detected in human breast milk ranging from 1.4 to 92.2 mg &mu;l&ndash;1 (10.5 &mu;g l&ndash;1 mean) in 18 US states (Kirk et al. 2005), and 1.3 to 411 &mu;g l&ndash;1 (9.1 &mu;g l&ndash;1 median) in the Boston area, United States (Pearce et al. 2007). Perchlorate has also been detected in human colostrum of 46 women in the Boston area (from &lt; 0.05 to 187.2 &mu;mol l&ndash;1 (Leung et al. 2009)). The mechanism of perchlorate action is quite simple, as it is believed to be mediated only by the NIS inhibition (Dohan et al., 2007; Wolff, 1998). Additionally, thiocyanate and nitrate are two known inhibitors that have been found to reduce circulating TH levels (Blount et al., 2006; Steinhaus et al., 2007), but they are both less potent than perchlorate (Tonacchera et al., 2004). However, there are also contradictory results from other studies that showed no correlation between thyroid parameters and perchlorate levels in humans (Pearce et al., 2010; Amitai et al., 2007; Tellez et al., 2005).  Co-occurrence of perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate can alter thyroid function in pregnant women. Horton et al. (2015) have shown positive associations between the weighted sum of urinary concentrations of these three analytes and increased TSH, with perchlorate showing the largest weight in the index. Interestingly, De Groef et al. 2006 showed that nitrate and thiocyanate, acquired through drinking water or food, account for a much larger proportion of iodine uptake inhibition than perchlorate, suggesting that NIS inhibition and any potential downstream effect by perchlorate are highly dependent on the presence of other environmental NIS inhibitors and iodine intake itself (Leung et al., 2010). In particular, Tonacchera et al. (2004) showed that the relative potency of perchlorate to inhibit radioactive I&minus; uptake by NIS is 15, 30 and 240 times that of thiocyanate, iodide, and nitrate respectively on a molar concentration basis. These data are in line with earlier studies in rats (Alexander and Wolff, 1996; Greer et al. 1966). Contradictory findings in these studies may therefore be a result of the confounding mixtures in the environment, masking the primary effect of perchlorate.  Decreased iodine intake can decrease TH production, and therefore exposure to perchlorate might be particularly detrimental in iodine-deficient individuals (Leung et al. 2010). Moreover, biologically based dose-response modeling of the relationships among iodide status (e.g., dietary iodine levels), perchlorate dose, and TH production in pregnant women has shown that iodide intake has a profound effect on the likelihood that exposure to goitrogens will produce hypothyroxinemia (Lewandowski et al. 2015).  During pregnancy TH requirements increase, particularly during the first trimester (Alexander et al. 2004; Leung et al. 2010), due to higher concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, placental T4 inner-ring deiodination leading to the inactive reverse T3 (rT3), and transfer of small amounts of T4 to the foetus (during the first trimester foetal thyroid function is absent). Moreover, glomerular filtration rate and clearance of proteins and other molecules are both increased during pregnancy, possibly causing increased renal iodide clearance and a decreased of circulating plasma iodine (Glinoer, 1997). Thus, even though the foetal thyroid can trap iodide by about 12 week of gestation (Fisher and Klein, 1981), high concentrations of maternal perchlorate may potentially decrease thyroidal iodine available to the foetus by inhibiting placental NIS (Leung et al. 2010).  Consequences of TH deficiency depend on the developmental timing of the deficiency (Zoeller and Rovet, 2004). For instance, if the TH deficiency occurs during early pregnancy, offspring show visual attention, visual processing and gross motor skills deficits, while if it occurs later, offspring may show subnormal visual and visuospatial skills, along with slower response speeds and motor deficits. If TH insufficiency occurs after birth, language and memory skills are most predominantly affected (Zoeller and Rovet, 2004).  Along this line, age and developmental stage are crucial in determining sensitivity to NIS inhibitors (e.g., perchlorate, thiocyanate, and nitrate). In this regard, McMullen et al. (2017) have shown that adolescent boys and girls, more than adults, represent vulnerable subpopulations to NIS symporter inhibitors. Altogether these studies indicate that age, gender, developmental stage, and dietary iodine levels can affect the impact of NIS inhibitors.  Finally, ten more small simple-structured molecules were identified in a large screening study (Lecat-Guillet et al., 2008b) that could block iodide uptake by specifically disrupting NIS in a dose-dependent manner. These molecules were named Iodide Transport Blockers (ITBs). There are few organic molecules that lead to NIS inhibition but no direct interaction with NIS has been determined (Gerard et al., 1994; Kaminsky et al., 1991). Up to date, only dysidenin, a toxin isolated from the marine sponge Dysidea herbacea, has been reported to specifically inhibit NIS (Van Sande et al., 2003). Finally, the aryltrifluoroborates were found to inhibit iodide uptake with an IC50 value of 0.4 &mu;M on rat-derived thyroid cells (Lecat-Guillet et al., 2008a). The biological activity is rationalized by the presence of the BF3&minus; ion as a minimal binding motif for substrate recognition at the iodide binding site.  It has been also shown that many anions, such as ClO3-, SCN-, NO3-, ReO4-, TcO4- and in a lower extent Br- and BF4-, are also acting as NIS substrates and they enter the cell by the same transporter mechanism (Van Sande et al., 2003). It has been also shown that ClO4- is transferred by NIS with high affinity and is considered as one of its most potent inhibitors (Dohan et al., 2007). Most recently, the aryltrifluoroborates were also shown to inhibit NIS function (Lecat-Guillet et al., 2008a). A library of 17,020 compounds was tested by a radioactive screening method with high specificity using transfected mammalian cells (Lecat-Guillet et al., 2008b; 2007) for NIS inhibition evaluation. Further studies with the most powerful inhibitors showed a high diversity in their structure and mode of action (Lindenthal et al., 2009)."@en ;

  dc:description "Text from LaLone et al. (2017) Weight of evidence evaluation of a network of adverse outcome pathways linking activaiton of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in honey bees to colony death. Science of the Total Environment 584-585, 751-775:  &quot;The nicotinoids and neonicotinoids are both agonists of the nAChR (Tomizawa and Casida, 2003); however, neonicotinoids are the primary chemicals considered in the AOPs relevant to bees. The potency of a nAChR agonist is dependent on the receptor subunit composition, structurally important amino acid residues at the binding site, and the ionization status of the chemical at physiological pH (Tomizawa and Casida, 2003; Dani and Bertrand, 2007). For example, nicotine is a classical vertebrate nAChR agonist; however, it has relatively low affinity (and insecticidal activity) for the invertebrate nAChR. Due to ionization, nicotine is poor at passing though the ion-impermeable barrier surrounding the insect central nervous system(CNS; Tomizawa and Casida, 2003). Conversely, non-ionizable neonicotinoids readily translocate into the insect CNS and have high affinity for the nAChR (e.g., Drosophila nAChR IC50 4.6 nM imidacloprid), with limited or no binding activity to vertebrate nAChR (Tomizawa and Casida, 2003). Various studies have demonstrated that similarities and differences in key amino acid residues in the ligand binding domain across species can lead to structural and binding site differences that dictate chemical interaction with the receptor (Dani and Bertrand, 2007; Matsuda et al., 2009; Tomizawa and Casida, 2009; Jones and Sattelle, 2010; LaLone et al., 2016). Due to the intended insecticidal action of neonicotinoids, a growing number of studies have been conducted to  evaluate potential adverse effects in non-target species such as honey bees exposed to neonicotinoids, particularly imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam. Some of the results of these studies are included in subsequent AOP descriptions.&quot;"@en ;

  dc:description "Because of the long latency of mammary tumors, the two-year rodent carcinogenicity bioassay is the primary assay for this adverse outcome. The assay is included in the OECD Test No. 451 and 453 for carcinogenicity and combined toxicity and carcinogenicity (OECD 2009; OECD 2009), and is also used by the US National Toxicology program (Chhabra, Huff et al. 1990), and the FDA (FDA (Food and Drug Administration) 2007), and referenced by the EPA (EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) 2005) in guidelines for risk assessments. Other assays from short term (2-4 weeks) and subchronic (90 day) to chronic (1 year) toxicity also call for the documentation of mammary tumors (FDA (Food and Drug Administration) 2007; OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) 2018), so these assays could capture the early onset of tumors, and could be modified to report earlier key events like proliferation and inflammation.  Several characteristics of classic cancer bioassays limit the sensitivity of these assays to mammary gland carcinogens. First, no assays require prenatal or early post-natal exposures for carcinogenicity testing. The US NIH&rsquo;s National Toxicology Program assays start exposures at five to six weeks of age and OECD regulatory assay exposures suggest (but do not require) exposures beginning after weaning and before eight weeks of age. Assays initiating exposures at later ages have diminished sensitivity to agents that affect breast development and increase future susceptibility to cancer, such as estrogenic hormones, DDT and dioxins (EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) 2005; Rudel, Fenton et al. 2011). Agents with similar activity to ionizing radiation and DNA damaging chemicals may not be fully captured in some of these assays, since sensitivity appears to peak around or before week seven for these agents (around puberty) (Imaoka, Nishimura et al. 2013). Second, carcinogenicity assay guidelines do not require the best methods for detecting tumors in mammary gland: whole mount preparations of mammary gland coupled with longitudinal sections (dorsoventral sections parallel to the body) of mammary gland for histology (Tucker, Foley et al. 2017). Palpation and transverse sections of mammary gland can easily miss tumors or lesions of interest. Interestingly the NTP reproductive toxicity guidelines do specify these preferable methods for mammary gland analysis.  Two additional factors affect the sensitivity of standard carcinogenicity assays. First, benign tumors are not always considered to be an indicator of carcinogenicity, leading to a possible underestimation of risk. &nbsp;NTP and EPA guidance suggest that benign tumors provide additional weight of evidence if malignant tumors are also present or if studies suggest benign tumors can progress to carcinogenicity. In a short-term study, benign tumors may indicate a need for a longer-term study. However, benign mammary tumors (fibroadenomas) almost always coincide with carcinogenic tumors in mammary gland or other organs, and carcinomas sometimes grow from fibroadnomas (Rudel, Attfield et al. 2007; Russo 2015) suggesting that benign tumors may be an underutilized indicator of carcinogenicity.  Finally, the dose selection guidance in carcinogenicity testing typically calls for a high dose that is sufficiently toxic to suppress body weight (OECD 2009). However, body weight interacts with risk of breast cancer (Haseman, Young et al. 1997; Rudel, Attfield et al. 2007), reducing the sensitivity of the upper end of the dose range and the likelihood of a positive dose-response."@en ;

  dc:description "Etoposide is one of the most well studied topoisomerase II targeted agents. It stabilizes covalent topoisomerase II-cleaved DNA complexes (ie cleavage complexes) by interacting at the enzyme-DNA interface in a noncovalent manner (Smith et al. 2014).  Etoposide ( and its derivatives) stimulate DNA cleavage mediated by yeast topoisomerase II.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of etoposide action, high levels of topoisomerase II-associated DNA breaks accumulate in treated cells (Hande et al. 1998; Ross et al 1984; Wistelrman et al.2007).  Etoposide quinone induces DNA cleavage via an enzyme-mediated mechanism. Control reactions were conducted in the absence of enzyme or drug (DNA Control), in the presence of 30 &mu;M etoposide quinone without enzyme (+EQ &minus;hTII&beta;), or in the presence of topoisomerase II&beta; without drug (&minus;EQ +hTII&beta;).&nbsp;The quinone induced &sim;4 times more enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage than did the parent drug. Furthermore, the potency of etoposide quinone was &sim;2 times greater against topoisomerase II&beta; than it was against topoisomerase II&alpha;, and the drug reacted &sim;2&ndash;4 times faster with the &beta; isoform. Etoposide quinone induced a higher ratio of double- to single-stranded breaks than etoposide, and its activity was less dependent on ATP (Smith et al. 2014).

  dc:description "Infant leukaemia (&lt;1 year old) is a rare disease of developmental origin distinct from adult and childhood leukaemias which fit the classical two-hit cancer model. Both genetic and haematological studies &nbsp;indicate an in utero origin at an early phase of foetal development. Investigation of identical twin pairs with infant leukaemia provided evidence of in-utero transfer of leukemic cells&nbsp;from one twin to the other (Ford AM, 1993), and the in-utero origin of this cancer was confirmed by retrospective analyses of neonatal blood spots from affected infants (Gale KB, 1997). The high concordance rate for leukaemia in monozygotic twins and the short latency of the disease suggest that MLL rearrangement in fetal hematopoietic stem cells causes infant leukaemia (Nanya M, 2015).&nbsp;Rearrangements of the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene producing abnormal fusion protein are the most frequent genetic/molecular hallmarks in infant B-cell ALL. In small epidemiological studies, mother/foetus pesticide exposure has been associated with infant leukaemia; however, strength of evidence and power of these studies are weak at best. Despite recent advances in the pathogenesis of pediatric leukemia, surrogate models such as in vitro, ex vivo or animals in vivo do not reproduce the human disease sufficiently and they suffer from difficulties in interpretation and extrapolation of findings and from the intrinsic limitation in cancer bio-assay design to cover relevant window of exposure. This&nbsp;adverse outcome pathway (AOP) is based substantially on an analogous disease &ndash; secondary acute leukaemia caused by etoposide, a topoisomerase II (TopoII) poison &ndash;, and on cellular and animal models. The topo II inhibitor, Etoposide, induces DNA double-strand breaks between the S and the G2/M phases of the cell cycle and is related to the post treatment occurence of the acutemyeloid leukaemia, which is showing a similar pattern of genetic changes as observed in the Infant Leukaemia (IFL) disease.&nbsp;Indeeed, the hallmark of the IFL and acute myeloid leukaemia is the formation of MLL gene rearrangements (MLLr) via TopoII poisoning, leading to fusion genes and eventually acute leukaemia by global (epi)genetic dysregulation. Current knowledge&nbsp;supports&nbsp;the possibility that MLL-rearrangment in infant leukaemia is caused by transplacental exposure to topo2 poisons. Although it is considered unusual for a pregnant woman to be directly exposed to drugs such as etoposide, other compounds presents in the environment&nbsp;may exert &nbsp;similar effects, and this is considered toxicologically relevant for risk assessment (Nanya M, 2015).&nbsp;This&nbsp;AOP condenses molecular, pathological, regulatory, clinical and epidemiological knowledge in a pragmatic framework with the aspiration of focussing on human specific hazard in the risk assessment process. This&nbsp;AOP enables to identify important gaps of knowledge relevant to risk assessment, including the specific embryonic target cell during the short and spatially restricted period of susceptibility and the role of (epi)genetic features modifying initiation and progression of the disease. Furthermore, this&nbsp;AOP informs on a potential integrated approach to testing and assessment (IATA) to address the risk caused by environmental chemicals in the future and represents a transparent and weight of evidence based tool to define the plausible causative mechanism necessary for the interpretation and integration of epidemiological studies in the process of risk assessment.&nbsp;This AOP was first developed by the EFSA PPR Panel as part of a Scientific Opinion&nbsp;and published in the&nbsp;EFSA Journal 2017;15(3):4691DOI:&nbsp;10.2903/j.efsa.2017.4691.&nbsp;A copyright for figures and for most of the references included in this AOP was delt with in the EFSA Scientific Opinion. In addition, EFSA granted&nbsp;a research project&nbsp; for assessing&nbsp;in vitro and in vivo the potential genotoxic contribution of etoposide, Permethrin &nbsp;and Chlorpyrifos&nbsp;in human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) at different ontogeny stages, spanning from embryonic to adult HSPCs, with a special emphasis in their ability to induce MLL breaks/damage (Rodriguez et al. 2020)"@en ;

  dc:description "Genotoxicity in general and carcinogenicity are apical endpoints in established regulatory guideline studies. TopoII poisoning has been listed as one of the potential mechanisms of genotoxicity and carcinogenicity in the ICH M7 guideline for human medicines. It is also known that some manifestations of genotoxicity in tests measuring chromosomal aberrations, micronuclei or DNA and chromosome damage (Comet assay) are partially due to double-strand breaks created by the disturbed action of TopoII enzymes.  &nbsp;The extended one generation test (OECD 443) includes a developmental immunotoxicity cohort. At present the cohort may identify post-natal effects of prenatal and neonatal exposures on the immune tissues and white blood cells population. However, each regulatory guideline study has potential limitations e.g. no specific parameters are in place to identify a pattern relevant to infant leukemia in humans in the extended one generation test, no treatment is occurring during the early in-utero development phase in the carcinogenicity studies&nbsp;and no considerations on the possible higher sensitivity of the HSC are in place for the genotoxicity assays.  Epidemiological evidence&nbsp; linking pesticide exposure to infant leukaemia, also suggests that pesticide exposure may have a greater impact on children than adults; though, almost all of the available evidence does&nbsp; not make a distinction between infant and childhood leukaemia.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, most epidemiological studies are limited because no specific pesticides have been directly associated with the risk of leukaemia, but rather the broad term &ldquo;pesticide exposure&rdquo; (Hernandez and Menendez 2016). In this perspective, this AOP would provide a regulatory relevant support for understanding the potential of a chemical to be involved in this toxicological pathway.&nbsp;It is however worth noting that IFL is not an animal disease &nbsp;and therefore the outcome of a chemically induced MLL translocation can likely only be tested at KE levels. In addition, MLL translocation is clearly a common node to alternative AOs not described in this AOP (chemotherapy induced leukaemia) and genotoxicity per se should be considered as adverse."@en ;

Historically, animal testing has formed the basis for such risk assessment exercises. Driven by scientific and ethical constraints, and initiated more than 3 decades ago, however, there is a clear tendency worldwide to increasingly address animal-free methods for this purpose. This has been reinforced by a number of legislative changes over the past few years in the European Union, imposing a ban on animal testing for particular groups of chemicals, in casu in the cosmetics field. This has been followed by other parts of the world, such as in Norway, Israel, India, New Zealand and the state of S&atilde;o Paulo in Brazil. In response to this ubiquitous matter, the scientific community has been urged to develop animal-free methods for evaluating the safety of chemicals, including in vitro and in silico assays, being a research area that is gaining momentum. Interestingly, this has triggered a paradigm shift from classical toxicology, focusing on apical endpoints for toxicity in animal models, to predictive toxicology, relying on information on mechanisms of toxic action.  A major tool adopted in predictive toxicology is the AOP framework, which refers to a conceptual construct that portrays existing knowledge concerning the linkage between a direct molecular initiating event (MIE) and an adverse outcome via a number of key events at a biological level of organization relevant to risk assessment. AOPs can serve several purposes pertinent to non-animal chemical risk assessment, such as read-across methods, integrated approaches to testing and assessment, quantitative structure-activity relationships or the elaboration of prioritization strategies. In fact, AOPs embody a number of proposed frameworks for the implementation of animal-free safety testing of chemicals. Such frameworks typically start with exposure assessment, physico-chemical profiling, read-across and biokinetic evaluation, all which dictate the subsequent selection of in vitro biomarkers and corresponding assays. For many new chemical entities, however, such pre-existing information may be scarce, which thus impedes targeted establishment of an in vitro testing battery.

  dc:description "Steatosis is the condition where an abnormal amount of fat is being stored within the liver. The liver is the site where sugars and fats are converted for the purposes of supplying energy to the rest of the body. The liver will convert glucose to fatty acids and package them as triglycerides for distribution throughout the body via the bloodstream and storage in adipose tissue. The liver also takes in fatty acids and triglycerides, and oxidizes them back to glucose for distribution throughout the body. When the influx/efflux and metabolism of fatty acids is altered, leading to a net increase in cellular fatty acids, the result is steatosis. As steatosis progresses, these fatty acids may lead to oxidative stress that ultimately leads to oncotic necrosis (cell death) and inflammatory cell infiltration (inflammation). This is termed steatohepatitis.&nbsp;&nbsp;"@en ;

  rdfs:label "Cyp2E1 Activation Leading to Liver Cancer"@en ;
  dc:source <https://h2020-sbd4nano.github.io/sbd-data-aopwiki/models/> ;
  dc:description "The subject of this AOP is xenobiotic metabolism by Cyp2E1 (MIE) during prolonged&nbsp;exposures, leading to liver cancer (AO). The intervening KEs are chronic oxidative stress, cytotoxicity, and regenerative proliferation. The setting for these events is the liver, which is the body&rsquo;s primary venue for chemical detoxification.  Xenobiotic metabolism typically occurs in three phases: (I) the chemical substrate is enzymatically bio-activated to its primary metabolite; (II) the metabolite(s) produced is (are) made less reactive through conjugation; and (III) the modified chemical(s) is (are) excreted. Cyp2E1 is a phase I P450 monooxygenase that bio-activates its substrates through the addition of an oxygen, thereby producing an electrophilic metabolite. Acting as an electrophile following metabolic activation is a key characteristic of a carcinogen (Smith, et al. 2015). While this reactive species often undergoes conjugation (phase II metabolism), sometimes it will react with cellular nucleophiles (e.g., proteins or DNA), which results in formation of adducts that produce cytotoxicity in extreme cases. Another feature of Cyp2E1 is that its catalytic cycle is prone to uncoupling, which leads to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are an important source of cytotoxicity (e.g., via lipid peroxidation) and are a source of oxidative lesions to DNA (which may be a source of cancer-causing mutations) (Caro and Cederbaum 2004). &nbsp;Redox-sensitive proteins are modified by oxidation; importantly, changes in gene expression are carried out by the redox-sensitive transcription factor Nrf2. Nrf2 increases the expression of genes that encode cyto-protective products, such as anti-oxidants and phase II conjugating enzymes (Furfaro, et al. 2016, Ma and He 2012, Sporn and Liby 2012, Tkachev, et al. 2011). At the same time, dying cells release pro-inflammatory signals and, together, these signals encourage regenerative proliferation of hepatocytes (Brenner, et al. 2013, Luedde, et al. 2014). However, when chronically activated, these molecular signals can produce dysregulated cellular proliferation in which the cytoprotective cellular mechanisms that are intended to promote tissue repair instead may lead to pre-malignant and malignant lesions.  This AOP explores these mechanisms in greater detail. Because exposure to Cyp2E1substrates is relatively common, this AOP will be an important tool for understanding the adverse health impacts of these potentially harmful substances. Cyp2E1 is well studied and is involved in the metabolism of a large number of substrates (Lieber 1997, Tanaka, et al. 2000), so it is impossible to summarize all of the evidence. &nbsp;Therefore, we report illustrative studies that support each KE and KER. In addition, because no single study has looked at each key event, supporting evidence is gathered from many studies that have used a variety of in vitro and in vivo systems, as well as a collection of Cyp2E1 substrates. We focus on evidence gathered from: furan (a group 2B carcinogen), ethanol (group 1), chloroform (group 2B), and carbon tetrachloride (group 2B). These compounds are established Cyp2E1 substrates that are known to be rodent carcinogens and are (group 1) or are suspected (group 2B) human carcinogens based on their International Agency for Research on Carcinogens (IARC) evaluations."@en ;

  dc:description "Characterization of chemical properties: Androgen receptor binding chemicals can be grouped into two broad structural domains, steroidal and non-steroidal (Yin et al. 2003). Steroidal androgens consist primarily of testosterone and its derivatives (Yin et al. 2003). Many of the non-steroidal AR binding chemicals studied are derivatives of well known non-steroidal AR antagonists like bicalutamide, hydroxyflutamide, and nilutamide (Yin et al. 2003). Nonetheless, a number of QSARs and SARs that consider AR binding of both these pharmaceutical agents as well as environmental chemicals have been developed (Waller et al. 1996; Serafimova et al. 2002; Todorov et al. 2011; Hong et al. 2003; Bohl et al. 2004). However, it has been shown that very minor structural differences can dramatically impact function as either an agonist or antagonist (Yin et al. 2003; Bohl et al. 2004; Norris et al. 2009), making it difficult at present to predict agonist versus antagonist activity based on chemical structure alone.  In vivo considerations: A variety of steroidal androgens can be converted to estrogens in vitro through the action of cytochrome P450 19 (aromatase). Structures subject to aromatization may behave in vivo as estrogens despite exhibiting potent androgen receptor agonism in vitro."@en ;

  dc:description "As stated earlier, there are many different ways by which pro-fibrotic stressors can interact with the components of cell membrane and often involve multiple interactions at the same time. Few studies investigate the exact interaction between the stressor and the cellular membrane components. Asbestos and silica crystals engage scavenger receptors present on the macrophages (Murthy et al., 2015). Bleomycin binds high affinity bleomycin binding sites present on rat alveolar macrophage surfaces, leading to macrophage activation (Denholm and Phan, 1990). However, the consequences of such interactions such as, the release of PRR agonists DAMPs (alarmins) from dying or injured cells, increased&nbsp; gene or protein synthesis downstream of receptor binding or in the case of NMs, their cellular uptake, are measured routinely as indicative of occurrence of such interactions (Nel et al., 2009; Cheng et al., 2013). Because of the phys-chem properties such as surface charge, NMs and asbestos like materials can bind to cellular macromolecules and cell surface/membrane components, which in turn, facilitate their uptake and intracellular sequestration by the cells (NIOSH, 2011a; Pascolo et al., 2013). Several DAMPs that can be effectively measured in biological samples and cultured cells include High Mobility Group Binding 1 (HMGB1) protein, Heat Shock proteins (HSPs), uric acid, annexins, and S100 proteins (Bianchi, 2007). Of all DAMPs, interleukin (IL)-1&alpha; is the most commonly measured alarmin. IL-1&alpha; is the principal pro-inflammatory moiety and is a designated &lsquo;alarmin&rsquo; in the cell that alerts the host to injury or damage (Di Paolo and Shayakhmetov, 2016). It is shown that administration of necrotic cells to mice results in neutrophilic inflammation that was entirely mediated by IL-1&alpha; released from the dying or necrosed cells and consequent activation of IL-1 Receptor 1 (IL-1R1) signalling (Suwara et al., 2014). IL-1&alpha; is released following exposure to MWCNTs (Nikota et al., 2017) and silica (Rabolli et al., 2014). Although IL1-b is not a designated alarmin, its secretion following exposure to stressors is routinely assessed and is linked to initiation of cell or tissue injury.  Other high aspect ratio fibres such as asbestos and CNTs induce frustrated phagocytosis and acute cell injury (Boyles et al., 2015; D&ouml;rger et al., 2001; Brown et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2010; Poland et al., 2008), leading to DAMP release (Nikota et al, 2017), inflammation and immune responses."@en ;

It is pertinent to remark that ambient (outdoor) and indoor particulate matter are risk factors for cardiovascular and the World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that 6.7 million annual premature deaths are associated with these risk factors (Vaduganathan et al., 2022; WHO, 2023)."@en ;

  dc:description "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide, being responsible for 32% of all deaths in 2019 (WHO; http://www.who.int). The term CVD covers all diseases of the cardiovascular system, including atherosclerosis, which is manifested as increased plaque deposition or build-up in the arteries. Although, atherosclerosis is not a cause of death, it can lead to fatal conditions as stroke and myocardial infarction. Atherosclerosis is normally an asymptotic disease and is initiated by a biological, chemical or physical insult to the artery walls. This leads to the expression of cell adhesion molecules on the endothelial lining of the arteries, which facilitates the activation, recruitment, and migration of monocytes through the endothelial monolayer (Cybulsky et al., 2001; Hansson &amp; Libby, 2006). Inside the intima layer, the monocytes differentiate into macrophages and internalize fatty deposits (mainly oxidized low-density lipoprotein). This results in them transforming into foam cells, which is a major component of the atherosclerotic fatty streaks. The fatty streaks reduce the elasticity of the artery walls and the foam cells promote a pro-inflammatory environment by secretion of cytokines and reactive oxidative species.&nbsp;In addition, foam cells also induce the recruitment of smooth muscle cells to the intima. Added together, these changes lead to the formation of plaques on the artery walls. A fibrous cap of collagen and vascular smooth muscle cells protects the necrotic core and stabilizes the plaque (Libby, 2012; Virmani et al., 2005). However, blood clots can be formed if the plaque ruptures. These may travel with the bloodstream and obstruct the blood flow of smaller vessels, e.g. the coronary arteries, which ultimately can lead to myocardial infarction.  Inhalation of particulate matter, chemicals and pathogens have been related to increased pulmonary inflammation. Whereas a normal immune reaction is crucial for effective elimination of threats to the body, chronic and unresolved inflammation has been linked to both adverse pulmonary and adverse systemic effects in humans. In concordance with this, various retrospective and prospective epidemiological studies have linked pulmonary exposure to respirable air particulates with increased the risk of developing CVD (Clancy, Goodman, Sinclair, &amp; Dockery, 2002; Dockery et al., 1993; Pope et al., 2004; Pope et al., 1995). Inhalation of particles has been proposed to affect the cardiovascular system in several different ways, including through disruption of vasomotor function and through acceleration of plaque progression in atherosclerosis (Cao et al., 2014; Moller et al., 2016).   Acute phase response is characterized by the change in plasma concentration of acute phase proteins (APP), along with other physiological changes during inflammatory conditions (Gabay &amp; Kushner, 1999; Mantovani &amp; Garlanda, 2023). Serum amyloid A (SAA) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are the major acute phase proteins in humans and are considered risk factors for CVDs (Table 1 presents acute phase response characteristics in humans and mice). In particular, SAA restricts the transport of cholesterol to the liver, allowing the accumulation of cholesterol in arteries and the formation of foam cells.  Table 1. Selected differences in APR between humans and mice.

Atherosclerosis is a disease influenced by multiple factors including high levels of lipoproteins in blood, elevated blood pressure, smoking, obesity, type 2 diabetes, diet, and physical activity (Herrington, Lacey, Sherliker, Armitage, &amp; Lewington, 2016; Libby et al., 2019; Raitakari, Pahkala, &amp; Magnussen, 2022). Inflammation is also involved in atherosclerosis, providing pathways via which risk factors might cause the development and advancement of atherosclerotic plaques (Libby, 2021a, 2021b). Therefore, although inflammation and acute phase response are not the only causes of atherosclerosis, the early key events (KE1, KE2 and KE3) can be used to evaluate the particle-induced risk of developing atherosclerosis.  For the development of AOP 237, the MIE and KE1 from AOP 173 have been used (AOP 173: Substance interaction with the pulmonary resident cell membrane components leading to pulmonary fibrosis). The information presented in AOP 173 has not been modified for AOP 237.  The development of the present AOP was supported by the EU project NanoPASS (Grant number: 101092741) and the Focused Research Effort on Chemicals in the Working Environment (FFIKA) form the Danish Government."@en ;

[27] Interestingly, some chemicals significantly alkylate proteins without causing toxicity, which suggests that only alkylation of a specific protein subset critical subset contributes to injury. Indeed, Codreanu presented an inventory of proteins affected by electrophile-mediated alkylation in intact cells and suggested that non-toxic covalent binding largely affects cytoskeletal protein components, whereas toxic covalent binding induces lethal injury by targeting factors involved in protein synthesis and catabolism and possibly mitochondrial electron transport. [3] In vitro covalent binding studies to macromolecules have been used to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms of chemical-induced toxicity. Experimental work with kidney epithelial cells by Chen et al suggested that following alkylation of cellular macromolecules as initial cytotoxic event both sulfhydryl depletion and lipid peroxidation are components of the cytotoxic mechanism [28]  Dennehy et al have analyzed the protein targets in nuclear and cytoplasmic proteomes from human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) treated in vitro with two biotin-tagged, thiol-reactive electrophiles and mapped the adducts. Certain protein families appeared particularly susceptible to alkylation. [29]  Shin et al have identified protein targets of two biotin-tagged model electrophiles in human liver microsomes through LC-MS-MS and showed that different target selectivities of the two electrophile probes correlated with different biological outcomes and that alkylation reactions of specific targets could be quantified.

  dc:description "Cardiovascular safety liabilities remain a major cause of drug attrition during preclinical and clinical development. Drug-induced cardiovascular toxicity was identified as an area of potential interest for AOP development by a network of experts convened by the UK National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement, and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs) and the European Union Reference Laboratory for alternatives to animal testing (EURL-ECVAM) in 2015. The blockade of L-type calcium channels (LTCCs) was proposed as one of the priority molecular initiating events (MIE) that may benefit from the AOP vision.  From a toxicological perspective, the key importance of ion currents for drug safety came to light with the discovery that hERG potassium channel inhibition is the most common mechanism of drug-induced long QT syndrome and torsades de pointes arrhythmia [PMID:16322774]. However, a growing body of research has demonstrated that drugs can affect more cardiac currents than previously expected (e.g. calcium current). Thus, the integrated assessment of drug inhibitory activity for multiple ion currents may provide a more accurate prediction of the toxicological risk [PMID:16322774]. Considering the newly recognized complexity of the phenomenon, several authors called for dedicated inter-disciplinary efforts aimed at improving our understanding of the mechanistic basis of cardiovascular liabilities, beyond hERG current blockade [PMID: 21306581]. This AOP is intended to support those efforts by providing a detailed map of the multi-scale effects mediated by LTCCs-blockade."@en ;

  dc:description "The mitochondrial OXPHOS machinery is a key physiological process responsible for producing the primary cellular energy, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). During OXPHOS, a series of redox reactions (oxidation) are mediated by protein complexes in an electron transport chain to create a protonmotive force (PMF) across the inner mitochondrial membrane (Liberman 1969). The PMF acts as a driving force of ATP synthesis through phosphorylation of adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Mitochondrial oxidation and phosphorylation are coupled to ensure continuous ATP supply for various physiological processes. A number of chemicals can bind to the inner mitochondrial membrane and dissipate the PMF, thus leading to uncoupling of OXPHOS and reduction in ATP synthetic efficiency. Classical &ldquo;uncouplers&rdquo; are normally protonophores with major characteristics of bulky hydrophobic moiety, an acid dissociable group and a strong electron-withdrawing group (Terada 1990). With the rapid development of in silico (Russom 1997; Schultz 1997; Naven 2012; Dreier 2019; Troger 2020) and in vitro (Escher 2002; Attene-Ramos 2013; Attene-Ramos 2015; Xia 2018) approaches, more and more uncouplers have been identified. However, their hazards to biota remain to be assessed. Uncoupling of OXPHOS can affect many ATP-dependent biological functions. In particular, cell proliferation as a major process to achieve organismal growth is positively correlated with the cellular ATP level and highly susceptible to energy depletion (Ramaiah 1964; Bonora 2012). Therefore, a link between uncoupling of OXPHOS and growth inhibition can be established with ATP depletion and reduced cell proliferation as the intermediate steps."@en ;

Mitochondrial oxidation and phosphorylation are coupled to ensure continuous ATP supply for various physiological processes. A number of chemicals can bind to the inner mitochondrial membrane and dissipate the PMF, thus leading to uncoupling of OXPHOS and reduction in ATP synthetic efficiency. Classical &ldquo;uncouplers&rdquo; are normally protonophores with major characteristics of bulky hydrophobic moiety, an acid dissociable group and a strong electron-withdrawing group (Terada 1990). With the rapid development of in silico (Russom 1997; Schultz 1997; Naven 2012; Dreier 2019; Troger 2020) and in vitro (Escher 2002; Attene-Ramos 2013; Attene-Ramos 2015; Xia 2018) approaches, more and more uncouplers have been identified. However, their hazards to biota remain to be assessed. Uncoupling of OXPHOS can affect many ATP-dependent biological functions. In particular, cell proliferation as a major process to achieve organismal growth is positively correlated with the cellular ATP level and highly susceptible to energy depletion (Ramaiah 1964; Bonora 2012). Therefore, a link between uncoupling of OXPHOS and growth inhibition can be established with ATP depletion and reduced cell proliferation as the intermediate steps."@en ;

  dc:description "At present the AOP framework is not readily used to support regulatory decision-making in radiation protection practices.The goal of developing this AOP is to bring attention to the framework as an effective means to organize knowledge and identify gaps associated with the mechanistic understanding of low dose radiation exposures. We have used lung cancer as the case example due to its relevance to both radiation and chemical risk assessment. This AOP will help build the concept of an &ldquo;all hazards&rdquo; approach to risk assessment, as it will be the first &nbsp;with a molecular initiating event that is specific to a radiation insult. This in turn could serve to identify networks that are critical to both radiation and chemical exposure scenarios and contribute to prioritizing co-exposures of relevance to risk assessment. By developing this AOP, we will support the necessary efforts highlighted by the international and national radiation protection agencies such as, the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation, International Commission of Radiological Protection, International Dose Effect Alliance and the Electric Power Research Institute Radiation Program to consolidate and enhance the knowledge in understanding the mechanisms of low dose radiation exposures from the cellular to organelle levels within the system."@en ;

  dc:description "It is well documented that ionizing radiation( (eg.&nbsp;X-rays, gamma, photons, alpha, beta, neutrons, heavy ions)&nbsp;leads to energy deposition on the atoms and molecules of the substrate. Many studies, have demonstrated that the type of radiation and distance from source has an impact on the pattern of energy deposition (Alloni, et al. 2014). High linear energy transfer (LET) radiation has been associated with higher-energy deposits (Liamsuwan et al., 2014) that are more densely-packed and cause more complex effects within the particle track (Hada and Georgakilas, 2008; Okayasu, 2012ab; Lorat et al., 2015; Nikitaki et al., 2016) in comparison to low LET radiation. Parameters such as mean lineal energy, dose mean lineal energy, frequency mean specific energy and dose mean specific energy can impact track structure of the traversed energy into a medium (Friedland et al., 2017). The detection of energy deposition by ionizing radiation can be demonstrated with the use of fluorescent nuclear track detectors (FNTDs). FNTDs used in conjunction with fluorescent microscopy, are able to visualize radiation tracks produced by ionizing radiation (Niklas et al., 2013; Kodaira et al., 2015; Sawakuchi and Akselrod, 2016). In addition, these FNTD chips can quantify the LET of primary and secondary radiation tracks up to 0.47 keV/um (Sawakuchi and Akselrod, 2016). This co-visualization of the radiation tracks and the cell markers enable the mapping of the radiation trajectory to specific cellular compartments, and the identification of accrued damage (Niklas et al., 2013; Kodaira et al., 2015). There are no known chemical initiators or prototypes that can mimic the MIE."@en ;

  dc:description "According to the World Cancer Research Fund, lung cancer is a disease that poses a significant healthcare burden world-wide. (https://www.wcrf.org/dietandcancer/cancer-trends/worldwide-cancer-data (https://www.wcrf.org/dietandcancer/cancer-trends/worldwide-cancer-data)). It is the most commonly diagnosed cancer with the highest incidence of occurrence on a global scale (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers). It is a multi-faceted disease exhibiting various genetic lesions and involving the accumulation of multiple molecular abnormalities over time. It is responsible for 1.5 million deaths annually. There is convincing evidence to show that smoking is an important risk modulating factor to lung cancer development.&nbsp; This risk is increased by age at which one starts, the total number of years&nbsp; and number of cigarettes smoked/day.&nbsp; Studies highlight smoking leads to the largest (relative) increases for small cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma and (Sobue et al., 1999 and Janssen-Heijnen et al., 2001). Other risk factors include lack of physical activity, genetic mutations, dietary factors, asbestos, air pollution (de Groot et al., 2012). Although the link between smoking and lung cancer has been well-established, environmental and indoor radiation exposure are also significant contributors. Risk assessment measures for defining acceptable exposure levels of radiation exposure still remain uncertain; including the scientific research to support the justifications. This is partially due to the assumption of a non-threshold and linear model at low doses with no consideration that cellular/tissue effects of low dose radiation exposure remain poorly understood.   Efforts were focused on developing a simple, unidirectional AOP to lung cancer using predominantly available data from radiation studies. Decades of research suggest that energy in the form of ionizing radiation can break DNA molecules. In vitro mutagenicity studies suggest that alterations in genes in the form of mutations, chromosomal aberrations and micronuclei formation may be important for cancer cell differentiation/proliferation and eventually neoplastic transformation (Harris, 1987). The MIE was selected to be &ldquo;deposition of energy&rdquo; as it is the initial measurable interaction at the macro-molecular level within an organism that can lead to a perturbation that initiates the AOP. The term accurately defines the initiating phenomena that manifest from any type of radiation insult (e.g., alpha- and beta-particles, photons, neutrons and heavy ions) and is distinguishable from chemical-based initiation events.&nbsp; Although the &ldquo;deposition of energy&rdquo; is itself a physical phenomenon (not biological) it is essential to describe the causal relationship between radiation insults and the stochastic onset of associated downstream biological damage. Historically, this relationship has been empirically observed and reported in the form of dose-response data. In addition, this MIE encapsulates the known varieties of radiation and their differing physical properties while still adhering to the stressor agnostic principles of the AOP framework.   &nbsp;This AOP has brought together molecular and cellular based research in the radiation realm and defined a modular, simplistic path towards lung cancer. It has used data&ndash;rich key events to a classic targeted response onto a cell that is applicable to multiple radiation stressors (e.g., X-rays, gamma rays, alpha particles, beta particles, heavy ions, neutrons) and well supported thorough empirical evidence. The proposed&nbsp;AOP is not the only route to lung cancer it is likely to be one linear path in a network of multiple pathways that may include other critical events.&nbsp; This hypothetical AOP will be networked to AOP-296, AOP-322, AOP-293, AOP-294 and AOP-303 forming a larger network of KEs related inflammation, apoptosis, and oxidative stress, providing a more complete path to lung cancer. This AOP is also a case example of how existing evidence from radiation stressors can stregthen empirical evidence surrounding key events that may be non-radiation specific and vice versa. By using a radiation centric molecular initiating event (MIE), networks can be developed for multiple adverse outcomes distinct to a radiation response. As different radiation stressors can trigger the MIE, the AOP will have wide applicability.   It is our goal, with the development of this AOP to motivate radiation researchers to use this framework for bringing together research data, exchanging knowledge, identifying priority areas and better co-ordinating research in the low-dose ionizing radiation field."@en ;

  dc:description "Numerous hydrophobic, amphipathic compounds are known to inhibit the proton pumping NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, also known as the ubiquinone reductase reaction of respiratory chain complex I (Fendel et al., 2008). However, the most studied examples of chemicals that inhibit CI are: rotenone and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) (Desplats et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2012; Sava et al., 2007). Both, rotenone (pesticide) and MPP+ (the active metabolite of MPTP) are well known to reproduce the anatomical, neurochemical, behavioural and neuropathological features of PD-like syndrome (Betarbet et al., 200; Greenamyre et al., 2001). Indeed, an overwhelming evidence has accumulated in the existing literature suggesting such a link and therefore these two inhibitors of CI will be discussed in the context of all KE identified in this AOP.  1. Rotenone affinity to complex I binding sites.  Rotenone (a flavonoid, extracted from the several plants e.g. Derris scandens)is one of the most powerful, an irreversible inhibitor of CI, binding with high affinity to CI and is typically used to define the specific activity of this complex. Rotenone is extremely lipophilic, it crosses biological membrane easily and it gets into brain very rapidly. Rotenone inhibits 20 kDa subunit of complex I (PSST) labeling without effect on 36 kDa subunit of complex I (ND1) (Schuler and Casida, 2001). The interaction of rotenone with active (&#39;pulsed&#39;) and thermally de-activated (&#39;resting&#39;) membrane-bound Complex I as revealed by inhibition of NADH-ubiquinone- and ubiquinol-NAD+ reductase activities was studied. Ki = 1 x 10(-9) M, k(on) = 5 x 10(7) M-1 min-1 and k(off) = 0.02 min-1 (inhibitory effect of rotenone on NADH oxidation) and Ki = 2 x 10(-8) M (inhibition of reverse electron transfer) were determined for pulsed enzyme. The equilibrium between de-activated and active enzyme is reached (K approximately 100) after the slow strongly temperature-dependent de-activation process has completed. Rotenone partially prevents and reverses the enzyme de-activation. About two order of magnitude difference in affinity of rotenone to the active and de-activated forms of the enzyme was demonstrated (Grivennikova et al., 1997). Dose-dependent relative affinities of rotenone to the inhibitory site of CI is shown in Fig. 3B (for more detail Grivennikova et al., 1997).  Most of the studies suggest that hydrophobic inhibitors like rotenone or Piericidin A most likely disrupt the electron transfer between the terminal Fe-S cluster N2 and ubiquinone (Fig. 3A).  &nbsp;    &nbsp;  Fig. 3A. Rotenone structure and a schematic representation of its binding site (and other Rotenone-like compounds) to CI. IMS: inter-membrane space (based on Lummen, 1998)  &nbsp;    &nbsp;  Fig. 3B. Fig. 2. Relative affinities of rotenone to the inhibitory site(s) of Complex I. Panel (A): activated submitochondrial particles (SMP) (2.8 mg/ml, approx. 0.4 microM Complex I) were incubated in the standard reaction mixture for 20 min at 25oC and residual initial rate of NADH oxidation was measured. 100% correspond to the specific activity of 1.0 micromol/min per mg of protein. Panel (B): curve 1 (o), SMP (48 microg/ml, approx. 8 nM Complex I) were activated in the assay cuvette and pre-incubated with rotenone in the presence of gramicidin and 10 mM malonate for 20 min at 25oC and the residual NADH oxidase activity was then measured; black circle: the same as (o), except that pre-incubation with rotenone was made in the presence of 10 mM succinate (no gramicidin and malonate), 10 mM malonate and gramicidin were added simultaneously with 100 microM NADH to measure the residual activity. Curve 2, presents the reverse electron transfer activity and curve 3, de-activated SMP were preincubated with rotenone as described for curve 1(o) (for further details see Grivennikova et al., 1997). Panel (C): The same as Panel B, curve 3, except for enzyme concentration was 0.5 mg/ml and rotenone concentration range which was increased to show interaction of the inhibitor with de-activated enzyme. The activity was measured after 200-fold dilution into the assay mixture. All the continues lines corresponds to the theoretical titration curves for the reversible single site inhibition with Ki values of 1 nM, 20 nM and 80 nM for the curves 1, 2 and 3, respectively (for further details see Grivennikova et al., 1997).   2. MPTP affinity to complex I binding sites. MPTP is not directly binding to CI and it is therefore non-toxic to DA neurons. MPTP exerts its toxicity after it is metabolized by mono-amino-oxidase, type B (MAO B), in astrocytes to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+). This metabolite binds to CI, and is toxic. MPP+ is a good substrate for dopamine transporters (DAT), expressed selectively by DA neurons (Greenamyre et al (2001). Due to both a positive charge and an amphoteric character, MPP+ specifically accumulates in mitochondria, where despite a lower affinity to the binding site of complex I than rotenone, it reaches high enough intra-mitochondrial concentrations to inhibit CI activity (Ramsay et al., 1991). The binding affinity of MPP+ is low (mM range), and it can be totally reversed by washing out.&nbsp; Competitive binding experiments with rotenone and MPP+ suggest that the two compounds bind to the same site of the CI (Ramasay et al., 1991). Schuler and Casida (2001) reported that MPP+ inhibits PSST and elevates ND1 labelling subunits of the mitochondrial complex I.  3. General characteristics of other complex I inhibitors. There is a variety of CI inhibitors, both naturally occurring besides rotenone such as Piericidin A (from Streptomyces mobaraensis), acetogenins (from various Annonaceae species) as well as their derivatives, and synthetically manufactured compounds like pyridaben and various piperazin derivatives (Ichimaru et al. 2008). They have been used to probe the catalytic activity of complex I especially in order to clarify its ubiquinone binding site and indeed, most of these compounds inhibit the electron transfer step from the Fe-S clusters to ubiquinone (Friedrich et al. 1994). Therefore, classification of CI inhibitors is based on their types of action. Type A inhibitors, like piericidin A, 2-decyl-4-quinazolinyl amine (DQA), annonin VI and rolliniastatin-1 and -2, are considered to be antagonists of the ubiquinone substrate. For piericidin A, it has been shown that it inhibits NADH:Q2 activity in a partially competitive manner. Contrary to type A, type B inhibitors, like the commonly used rotenone, have hydrogen-bonding acceptors only in the cyclic head of the molecule and are non-competitive towards UQ (ubiquinone), but are believed to displace the semiquinone intermediate during the catalysis (Fig. 2). Finally, inhibitors classified as type C, like stigmatellin and capsaicin, form a third group of hydrophobic CI inhibitors that are believed to act as antagonists of reduced ubiquinone (Degli Esposti 1998, Friedrich et al. 1994, Haefeli 2012) (Fig. 2). Competition studies with representatives of all three different types of inhibitors revealed that type A and B and type B and C, but not type A and C, compete with each other for binding. This led to a suggestion that all CI inhibitors acting at the ubiquinone binding pocket share a common binding domain with partially overlapping sites (Okun et al. 1999).  Some inhibitors bind to the outside of the ubiquinone reduction site and do not fit the preceding classification. Examples of such compounds are ADP-ribose, which competes for substrate binding at the NADH site (Zharova and Vinogradov, 1997), and diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) that covalently binds to reduced flavin mononucleotide (FMN) in the hydrophilic part of the enzyme blocking the electron transfer to the Fe-S clusters (Majander et al., 1994). There are also new, commercially available insecticides/acaricides with potential to inhibit mitochondrial respiration such as benzimidazole, bullatacin, 6-chlorobenzothiadiazole, cyhalothrin, Fenazaquin Fenpyroximate, Hoe 110779, Pyridaben, Pyrimidifen, Sandoz 547A, Tebufenpyrad and Thiangazole (Greenamyre et al., 2001). It is clear that they are capable of inhibiting the mammalian CI of mitochondrial respiratory chain, by binding to and blocking ubiquinone-dependent NADH oxidation with high efficacy (Lummen, 1998)."@en ;

MPTP affinity to complex I binding sites. MPTP is not directly binding to CI and it is therefore non-toxic to DA neurons. MPTP exerts its toxicity after it is metabolized by mono-amino-oxidase, type B (MAO B), in astrocytes to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+). This metabolite binds to CI, and is toxic. MPP+ is a good substrate for dopamine transporters (DAT), expressed selectively by DA neurons (Greenamyre et al (2001). Due to both a positive charge and an amphoteric character, MPP+ specifically accumulates in mitochondria, where despite a lower affinity to the binding site of complex I than rotenone, it reaches high enough intra-mitochondrial concentrations to inhibit CI activity (Ramsay et al., 1991). The binding affinity of MPP+ is low (mM range), and it can be totally reversed by washing out.&nbsp; Competitive binding experiments with rotenone and MPP+ suggest that the two compounds bind to the same site of the CI (Ramasay et al., 1991). Schuler and Casida (2001) reported that MPP+ inhibits PSST and elevates ND1 labelling subunits of the mitochondrial complex I.  3. General characteristics of other complex I inhibitors. There is a variety of CI inhibitors, both naturally occurring besides rotenone such as Piericidin A (from Streptomyces mobaraensis), acetogenins (from various Annonaceae species) as well as their derivatives, and synthetically manufactured compounds like pyridaben and various piperazin derivatives (Ichimaru et al. 2008). They have been used to probe the catalytic activity of complex I especially in order to clarify its ubiquinone binding site and indeed, most of these compounds inhibit the electron transfer step from the Fe-S clusters to ubiquinone (Friedrich et al. 1994). Therefore, classification of CI inhibitors is based on their types of action. Type A inhibitors, like piericidin A, 2-decyl-4-quinazolinyl amine (DQA), annonin VI and rolliniastatin-1 and -2, are considered to be antagonists of the ubiquinone substrate. For piericidin A, it has been shown that it inhibits NADH:Q2 activity in a partially competitive manner. Contrary to type A, type B inhibitors, like the commonly used rotenone, have hydrogen-bonding acceptors only in the cyclic head of the molecule and are non-competitive towards UQ (ubiquinone), but are believed to displace the semiquinone intermediate during the catalysis (Fig. 2). Finally, inhibitors classified as type C, like stigmatellin and capsaicin, form a third group of hydrophobic CI inhibitors that are believed to act as antagonists of reduced ubiquinone (Degli Esposti 1998, Friedrich et al. 1994, Haefeli 2012) (Fig. 2). Competition studies with representatives of all three different types of inhibitors revealed that type A and B and type B and C, but not type A and C, compete with each other for binding. This led to a suggestion that all CI inhibitors acting at the ubiquinone binding pocket share a common binding domain with partially overlapping sites (Okun et al. 1999).  Some inhibitors bind to the outside of the ubiquinone reduction site and do not fit the preceding classification. Examples of such compounds are ADP-ribose, which competes for substrate binding at the NADH site (Zharova and Vinogradov, 1997), and diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) that covalently binds to reduced flavin mononucleotide (FMN) in the hydrophilic part of the enzyme blocking the electron transfer to the Fe-S clusters (Majander et al., 1994). There are also new, commercially available insecticides/acaricides with potential to inhibit mitochondrial respiration such as benzimidazole, bullatacin, 6-chlorobenzothiadiazole, cyhalothrin, Fenazaquin Fenpyroximate, Hoe 110779, Pyridaben, Pyrimidifen, Sandoz 547A, Tebufenpyrad and Thiangazole (Greenamyre et al., 2001). It is clear that they are capable of inhibiting the mammalian CI of mitochondrial respiratory chain, by binding to and blocking ubiquinone-dependent NADH oxidation with high efficacy (Lummen, 1998)."@en ;

  dc:description "The ICH S8 guideline, which covers immunosuppression of small molecule drugs, determines the need for immunotoxicity studies by comprehensively evaluating the findings of pharmacology, changes in the immune system in repeated-dose toxicity studies, and other factors using a Weight of Evidence approach. If there is concern about immunotoxicity, the presence or absence of immunotoxicity should be determined using an in vivo test system capable of assessing the functional changes of predicted immunotoxic target cells. If immunotoxicity is observed, additional studies including in vitro assays or clinical evaluation should be considered to assess the risk of immunotoxicity in humans. Because TDAR involves many immune cell populations, including T cells, B cells, and antigen-presenting cells, evaluation of TDAR is recommended when there is concern about immunotoxicity but the immunotoxic target cells are unclear. The S8 guidelines list KLH, SRBC, and tetanus toxin as antigens for TDAR.  The draft FDA immunotoxicity testing guidance (2020) covers immunosuppressive and immunostimulatory drugs and biologics; evaluating immunosuppressive drugs in the draft FDA guidance is similar to that in the S8 guideline, with in vivo TDAR assays recommended when toxic target cells are unknown. The draft guidance states that TDAR assays using KLH as an antigen have been established in mice, rats, dogs, minipigs, and cynomolgus monkeys, but the use of SRBC and tetanus toxin as antigens is also acceptable.  For the assessment for pesticides, US EPA OPPTS 870.7800 immunotoxicity testing guideline recommends TDAR using SRBC. The REACH guideline does not provide for immunotoxicity testing, but it provides triggers for conducting immunotoxicity testing.  The WHO/IPSS Immunotoxicity Risk assessment Guidance (2012) describes a strategy for assessing five categories of immunotoxicity risks, including immunosuppression. For risk assessment of immunosuppression, it calls for identification of immunosuppression risks, prediction of pathogenesis that may occur, and consideration of safety margins based on the WoE approach from human findings, infection resistance tests, immune function tests, general immune system assays, histopathological findings and organ weights in general toxicity studies, and hematological data.  The evaluation of immunotoxicity in F1 animals in the OECD Guidelines for Extended First Generation Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity Studies (TG443) requires that PFC and ELSA assays to measure primary IgM antibody production by TDAR using T-cell dependent antigens (SRBC, KLH, etc.) be performed. Furthermore, if changes are observed, the significance of the changes should be examined by comprehensively evaluating other data.  The outcomes of immunosuppression are susceptibility to infection and tumorigenesis, and the FDA guidance requires that immunosuppressive drugs be evaluated for carcinogenic risk using WoE approach based on the results of carcinogenicity and immunotoxicity studies. Meanwhile, the ICH S1B(R1) Draft Step 2 Guidelines for Carcinogenicity Testing calls for evaluation of carcinogenicity by WoE approach instead of rat carcinogenicity testing, because rodent carcinogenicity test models are less capable of detecting carcinogenicity. On the other hand, it is difficult to define susceptibility to infection as a measurable AO with a clear mechanism, because immune responses vary among pathogens. In fact, many immunotoxicity guidelines require that the risk of immunotoxicity be identified and assessed by evaluating immune functions.  It was difficult to define susceptibility to infection as an AO, so TDAR, which is recommended as an indicator of immunosuppresoin in many guidelines, was used as an AO. It is expected that several AOPs with TDARs as AOs will be developed, and based on these AOPs, it may be possible to develop an IATA to assess the risk of immunotoxicity characterized by TDARs."@en ;

  dc:description "The pleiotropic cytokine IL-1 mediates its biological functions via association with the signaling receptor IL-1R1. These may include initiation of innate immunity and assistance of host defense, and sometimes, mediation of autoinflammatory, such as cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome, neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease and familial Mediterranean fever. The trimeric complex consists of IL-1, IL-1R1 and IL-1R3 (a coreceptor, formerly IL-1R accessory protein) allows for the approximation of the Toll-IL-1-Receptor (TIR) domains of each receptor chain. MyD88 then binds to the TIR domains. The binding of MyD88 triggers a cascade of kinases that produce a strong pro-inflammatory signal leading to activation of NF-&kappa;B and/or AP-1 and fundamental inflammatory responses such as the induction of cyclooxygenase type 2, production of multiple cytokines and chemokines, increased expression of adhesion molecules, or synthesis of nitric oxide. (Dinarello, 2018; Weber et al., 2010a, b; Jain et al., 2014).&nbsp;   &nbsp;  Molecules like nuclear or mitochondrial DNA, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), uridine triphosphate (UTP), uric acid and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) are classified as damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). DAMPs are secreted or produced upon cellular injury or death and induce sterile inflammation. On the other hand, bacterial products like lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycans, lipoprotein flagellins, bacterial RNA and DNA are some of the well-characterized pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). These DAMPs and PAMPs with a few exceptions bind to pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as toll-like receptor (TLRs) and nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD) like receptors (NLRs). Proinflammatory mediators such as DAMPs, PAMPs, and various inflammatory cytokines or mediators including IL-1&beta; itself activate innate immune mechanisms in the host leading to IL-1&beta; production (Handa et al., 2016; Newton and Dixit, 2012; Yang et al., 2017). Besides transcriptional regulation and posttranscriptional level by RNA-binding proteins, pro-IL-1&beta; protein requires proteolytic cleavage by active caspase-1 as the effector component of stimulation-induced multi-protein inflammasomes to acquire functional activity. Altogether, these different layers of regulation allow to fine tune IL-1&beta; production under different pathophysiological conditions (Bent et al., 2018).  &nbsp;  Therefore, the inhibition of various targets in different layers from the stimulation of PRRs or the receptors of proinflammatory cytokines, e.g., IL-1, IL-18, or TNFa, to the activation of NF-&kappa;B and/or AP-1 or the inhibition of posttranscriptional regulation of pro-IL-1&beta; cause impaired IL-1R1 signaling. In addition, since IL-1 also mediates autoinflammatory syndromes, such as cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome, neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease and familial Mediterranean fever, several inhibitors against IL-1R1 have been developed. They are IL-1 receptor antagonist（IL-1Ra）, anakinumab (anti-IL-1&beta; antibody) and rilonacept (soluble IL-1R). Several reports described that the administration of these drugs led to increased susceptibility to infection(De Benedetti et al., 2018; Fleischmann et al., 2003; Genovese et al., 2004; Imagawa et al., 2013; Kullenberg et al., 2016; Lachmann et al., 2009; Lequerre et al., 2008; Migkos et al., 2015; Schlesinger et al., 2012; Yokota et al., 2017). In addition to these human data, the experiments using knockout mice revealed that the lack of IL-1 signaling led to bacterial, tuberculosis or viral infection(Guler et al., 2011; Horino et al., 2009; Juffermans et al., 2000; Tian et al., 2017; Yamada et al., 2000)."@en ;

  dc:description "Dex inhibits IL-1&beta; gene expression in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells by blocking NF-&kappa;B/Rel and AP-1 activation (Jeon et al., 2000).  Dex suppresses LPS-induced gene expression of IL-1&beta; in rat lung. (in vivo) (Qiu et al., 1997)  Dex inhibits the release of IL-1&beta; by human leukocyte stimulated with Streptococcus pneumoniae stimulation (van Furth et al., 1995).  Treatment of peripheral blood monocytes with 2 mg/ml LPS potently increased IL-1&beta; release (p= 0.001) and Dex (10 -7 M) significantly reduced both resting and stimulated IL-1&beta; release (p 0.009).) (Morand, Rickard and Goulding, 1993)  Dex effectively blocks the glutamine antagonist acivicin-induced expression of IL-1&beta; mRNA by HL-60 leukemia cells (Weinberg, Mason and Wortham, 1992).  &nbsp;  LPS treatment induced a significant upregulation of the mRNA and release of IL-1&beta; from retinal microglia. Minocycline inhibited its releases. Thus, minocycline might exert its anti-inflammatory effect on microglia by inhibiting the expression and release of IL-1&beta; (Wang et al., 2005).  &nbsp;  Caspase-1 inhibition reduced the release of IL-1&beta; in organotypic slices exposed to LPS+ATP. Administration of pralnacasan (intracerebroventricular, 50 &mu;g) or belnacasan (intraperitoneal, 25&ndash;200 mg/kg) to rats blocked seizure-induced production of IL-1&beta; in the hippocampus, and resulted in a twofold delay in seizure onset and 50% reduction in seizure duration (Ravizza et al., 2006).  Belnacasan, an orally active IL-1&beta; converting enzyme/caspase-1 inhibitor, blocked IL-1&beta; secretion with equal potency in LPS-stimulated cells from familial cold urticarial associated syndrome and control subjects (Stack et al., 2005).  &nbsp;  In LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI) mice model, LPS induced inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-&alpha;, IL-6, IL-13 and IL-1&beta; were significantly decreased by cinnamaldehyde (CA) (Huang and Wang, 2017).  The suppressing capacities of six cinnamaldehyde-related compounds were evaluated and compared by using the LPS-primed and ATP-activated macrophages. At concentrations of 25~100 M, cinnamaldehyde and 2-methoxy cinnamaldehyde dose-dependently inhibited IL-1&beta; secretion (Ho, Chang and Chang, 2018).  In vitro, CA decreased the levels of pro-IL-1&beta; and IL-1&beta; in cell culture supernatants, as well as the expression of NLRP3 and IL-1&beta; mRNA in cells. In vivo, CA decreased IL-1&beta; production in serum. Furthermore, CA suppressed LPS-induced NLRP3, p20, Pro-IL-1&beta;, P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) and cathepsin B protein expression in lung, as well as the expression of NLRP3 and IL-1&beta; mRNA (Xu et al., 2017).  &nbsp;  IL-1 is known to mediates autoinflammatory syndrome, such as cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome, neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease and familial Mediterranean fever. Blocking of binding of IL-1 to IL-1R1 by anakinra, canakinumab, and rilonacept have been already used to treat these autoinflammatory syndrome associated with overactivation of IL-1 signaling (Quartier, 2011).   &nbsp;  Various inhibitors for NF‐&kappa;B, such as dimethyl fumarate, curcumin, iguratimod, epigalocathechin gallate (EGCG), and DHMEQ inhibits LPS-induced NF-&kappa;B activation and LPS-induced secretion of IL-1b (McGuire et al., 2016; Mucke, 2012; Peng et al., 2012; Suzuki and Umezawa, 2006; Wang et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2018; Wheeler et al., 2004).  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Several chemicals that targe some of these molecules, an inhibitors of TLR4 such as TAK-242 (Matsunaga et al., 2011) and various IRAK4 inhibitors (Lee et al., 2017). IRAK4 has recently attracted attention as a therapeutic target for inflammation and tumor diseases.  IL-1Ra binds IL-1R but does not initiate IL-1 signal transduction (Dripps et al., 1991). Recombinant IL-1Ra (anakinra) is fully active in blocking the IL-1R1, and therefore, the biological activities of IL-1&alpha; and IL-1&beta;. The binding of IL-1&alpha; and IL-1&beta; to IL-1R1 can be suppressed by soluble IL-1R like rilonacept (Kapur and Bonk, 2009). The binding of IL-1&beta; to IL-1R1 can be inhibited by anti-IL-1&beta; antibody (canakinumab and gevokizumab) (Church and McDermott, 2009) (Roell et al., 2010).  &nbsp;  Various IRAK4 inhibitors are currently under the investigation on the possibility of clinical use for autoimmune disorders (Chaudhary, Robinson and Romero, 2015).  &nbsp;  &nbsp;"@en ;

  dc:description "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been specifically designed to inhibit cyclooxygenase active site of PTGS; these mechanisms of inhibition are well characterized (Simmons et al, 2004). NSAIDs interfere with COX site via multiple mechanisms including competitive inhibition (most NSAIDs compete for active site with arachidonic acid) and covalent modification (irreversible acetylation) of COX (e.g., aspirin) (Simmons et al., 2004; Willoughby et al., 2011). NSAIDs display different levels of selectivity for the COX-1 vs. COX-2 isoforms (Simmons et al., 2004). Majority of NSAIDs inhibit both isoforms (with variable levels of selectivity for COX-1 vs. COX-2), but several have been designed to preferentially inhibit COX-2 (Bacchi et al., 2012). Recently, COX-1 specific inhibitors have been developed and their therapeutic potential is being explored (Liedtke et al., 2012). Most extensive evidence regarding chemical initiation of this event comes from the mammalian literature and relates to NSAIDs. In addition to NSAIDs, common environmental contaminants of diverse chemical structures and uses (e.g., parabens, phthalates, benzophenones) have been postulated to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis via COX inhibition (Kristensen et al., 2011). U.S. EPA’s high throughput screening program (ACToR, epa.gov) indicated COX as a frequent contaminant target - 61% of 143 tested chemicals inhibited COX-1 and 59% of 106 inhibited COX-2 activity. Several chemicals were either similar in potency (e.g., monobutylphthalate) or more potent than NSAIDs (e.g., insecticide emamectin benzoate and industrial intermediary 1-Chloro-4-nitrobenzene were more potent inhibitors of COX2 than NSAID celecoxib, which was specifically designed to inhibit COX-2). Mechanisms of inhibition for these chemicals are not well elucidated."@en ;

  dc:description "Organophosphate and carbamate insecticides are prototypical AChE inhibitors. The OP and carbamate pesticides were synthesized specifically to act as inhibitors of AChE, with OPs developed from early nerve agents (e.g., sarin) and carbamate pesticides based on the natural plant alkaloid physostigmine (Ecobichon 2001). 	A positive and significant correlation between the log of the Eserine IC50 (in vitro) for AChE inhibition and the log Km value for the AChE in the fish and crustacea species has been reported, explaining 92% of the variation in enzyme inhibition (Monserrat and Bianchini, 2001). Similar success was found in relating the rate constants for inhibition of AChE in housefly and the pseudo first-order hydrolysis rate constant for active forms of OPs (Fukuto 1990).    	The open literature includes many studies on vertebrate and invertebrate species that demonstrate a clear dependence of AChE activity on the dose or concentration of the substance with increased concentrations leading to an increase in the inhibition of AChE (e.g., fish ( Karen et al., 2001), birds (Hudson et al., 1984 (see dimethoate and disulfoton), Grue and Shipley 1984; and Al-Zubaidy et al., 2011); cladocera (Barata et al., 2004); nematodes (Rajini et al., 2008); rodents (Roberts et al., 1988; and mollusk (Bianco et al., 2011)). 	The open literature includes many studies on vertebrate and invertebrate species that demonstrate a clear relationship between increasing AChE inhibition as duration of exposure increases (e.g., amphibians ( Venturino et al., 2001); fish (Rao 2008; Ferrari et al., 2004); insects (Rose and Sparks 1984); birds (Ludke 1985; Grue and Shipley 1984); annelids (Reddy and Rao 2008); cladocera (Barata et al., 2004)). 	Rao et al. 2008 exposed the estuarine fish Oreochromis mossambicus to a 24 h LC50 concentration of chlorpyrifos and reported that it took 6 hr to reach &gt;40% AChE inhibition and 24 hr to reach 90% AChE inhibition. It took &gt;100 days to recover to normal AChE levels when fish were placed in clean water. 	A time course study of earthworms (Eisenis foetida) exposed to the 48 hr LC50 of profenofos found a significant relationship (between increases in percent inhibition of AChE and increase in time of exposure from 8-48 hrs (Chakra Reddy and Rao 2008)."@en ;

  dc:description "Mercury (Methylmercury, mercury chloride)  The binding of Methylmercury (MeHg) to redox sensitive thiol- or selenol-groups can disrupt the activity of enzymes or the biochemical role of non-enzymatic proteins. The stable or transitory interaction (binding) of MeHg with critical thiol and selenol groups in target enzymes can disrupt the biological function of different types of enzymes, particularly of the antioxidant selenoenzymes thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and glutathione peroxidase isoforms. The dysregulation of cerebral glutathione (GSH and GSSG) and thioredoxin [Trx or Trx(SH)2] &nbsp;systems by MeHg (Farina et al. 2011; Branco et al. 2017) can impair the fine cellular redox balance via disruption of sensitive cysteinyl- or thiol-containing proteins (Go etal., 2013; Go et al. 2014; Jones 2015).   &nbsp;    Figure 1 &ndash; Hypothetical Binding of MeHg to different types of target proteins. The binding of MeHg to proteins can cause either a transitory inhibition of the protein fucntion (first line, the yellow protein was reactivated by interacting with LMM-SH or R-SH). The pink protein is an example of protein that after the binding of MeHg suffered a change in the structure in such a way that it cannot be reactivated by LMM-SH or R-SH.&nbsp; The third protein (blue) is an example of protein that was permanently denaturated after MeHg binding and even after the removal of MeHg the activity was not recovered. The same type of interactions can be applied to the selenol-containing proteins (i.e., the selenoproteins).  The affinity of Mercury chloride (Hg2+) for thiol and selenol groups is higher than that of MeHg (compare Table 2 with Table 1). The constants described in Table 1 and 2 indicate that MeHg and Hg2+ behave as&nbsp; strong soft electrophiles, i.e., theyhave much higher affinity for the soft nucleophiles centers of thiol- and selenol-containing molecules (Rabenstein 1978a; Arnold et al. 1986; Sugiura et al., 1976).Furthermore, the rate constant for the reaction of MeHg with thiol/thiolate (R-SH/R-S-) has been estimated to be about 6 x 108 M-1.sec-1,&nbsp; indicating that the reactions of electrophilic forms of Hg (EpHg+&nbsp;; here MeHg and Hg2+) with thiolate and selenolate groups are diffusion controlled reactions (Rabenstein&nbsp; and Fairhurst, 1975). The constant indicates that the binding of EpHg+ to thiolate (-S-) or selenolate (-Se-) groups will occurr almost instaneously, when an EpHg+ collides with &ndash;S- or -Se- groups.  The studies of Rabenstein and others have also pointed out that the affinity of MeHg for &ndash;SeH groups is higher than for&nbsp; &ndash;SH groups (Sugira et al. 1976; Arnold et al. 1986). Consequently, &ndash;SeH-containing molecules (i.e., selenoproteins) should be the preferential targets for MeHg (Farina et al. 2011). Accordingly, several studies have demonstrate that the selenoenzymes glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) were inhibited after in vitro and in vivo exposure to MeHg&nbsp; or Hg2+ (Carvalho et al., 2008a; 2011, Farina et al.,&nbsp; 2009; Franco et al., 2009; Wagner et al., 2010; Branco et al., 2011; 2012; 2014, 2017; Dalla Corte et al., 2013; Meinerz et al., 2017).  As corollary, the occurrence of free MeHg and Hg2+ or bound to other ligands such as carboxylates, amines, chloride or hydroxyl anions in the physiological media of living cells is insignificant or nonexistent (George et al. 2008). The binding of MeHg to abundant low molecular mass thiols or LMM-SH (e.g., cysteine and reduced glutathione-GSH) and high molecular mass thiol-containing proteins or HMM-SH (e.g., albumin, hemoglobin, etc) is critical for the MeHg distribution from non-target to target organs and cells (Farina et al. 2017). The coordination of MeHg with one &ndash;S- group of a LMM-SH will determine MeHg distribution to its targets organs, including the brain. The coordination of Hg2+ with two &ndash;S- of LMM-SH molecules (particularly, cysteine or Cys) will determine the distribution of Hg2+ to kidney (which is its main target) and to non-classical targets organs, such as the brain (Oliveira et al. 2017). The entrance of Hg2+ into the brain is proportionally small, but recent literature data have indicated the neurotoxicity of very low and environmentally relevant doses of Hg2+ in rodents (Mello-Carpes et al. 2013&nbsp;), which confirms data obtained with toxic doses in rodents (Peixoto et al. 2007&nbsp;;&nbsp; Franciscato et al. 2009&nbsp;; Chehimi et al. 2012).  Table 1 - Affinity constants of methylmercury for important chemical groups found in biomolecules (adapted from aRabestein, 1978a, bRabestein and Bravo, 1987, using different thiol-containing molecules with the arylmercurialpara-mercurybenzenosulfonate,&nbsp; and from cArnold et al. 1986 taking into consideration that the calculated formation constant of &ndash;Se-MeHg conjugates was 0.1 to 1.2 order greater than that of &ndash;S-MeHg).

The values were adapted &nbsp;from Stricks and Kolthoff 1953; Mousavi 2011 and Liem-Nguyem et al. 2017.  We have to emphasize that what we call of binding to &ndash;SH or &ndash;SeH groups is, in fact, an exchange reaction of MeHg from MeHg-S conjugates (e.g., MeHg-cysteine or MeHg-Cys and MeHg-glutathione or MeHg-SG. conjugates) to&nbsp; a free thiol/thiolate- or selenol/selenolate-group from non-target or target proteins. Thus, the interaction of MeHg with its target proteins in the brain usually involves the exchange of MeHg from low-molecular mass conjugates (LMM-S-conjugates) to a thiol or selenol group in different types of proteins (Rabenstein 1978b; Rabenstein and Fairhurst, 1975; Reid and Rabenstein et al.; 1982; Rabenstein and Reid, 1984; Arnold et al. 1986; Farina et al. 2011, 2017; D&oacute;rea et al. 2013).     Figure 2 &ndash; Binding of MeHg (CH3Hg+) to target thiol- (HMM-SH) or selenol-containing proteins (HMM-SeH). Note that, in fact, the binding of MeHg to their high molecular mass target proteins is mediated by exchange reactions of MeHg from low molecular mass thiol (LMM-SH) molecules to HMM-SH (represented by Prot-SH) or HMM-SeH (represented by Prot-SeH). The scheme also demonstrated that MeHg conjugated with one LMM-SH (here represented by either Cys1-SHgCH3 or G1SHgCH3) can exchange with others LMM-SH (here represented by Cys2-SH or G2SH). After one exchange reaction, the conjugated Cys1-SHgCH3 and G1SHgCH3 release the free LMM-SH molecules Cys1-SH or G1SH.  &nbsp;  Table 3: References for the inhibition by MeHg and Hg2+ of SH-/seleno-proteins involved in protection against oxidative stress   	 		 			 			Protein activity inhibited by MeHg 			 			 			Exposure 			 			 			Functional group likely involved in the inhibition 			 			 			Organism-preparation 			 			 			&nbsp; 			 		 		 			 			Glutathione peroxidase (total GPx) 			 			 			in vivo 			 			 			-SeH 			 			 			Adult mice 			 			 			Glasser et al. 2013 			 		 		 			 			Total GPx 			 			 			in vivo 			 			 			-SeH 			 			 			Adult mice 			 			 			Glasser et al. 2010a 			 		 		 			 			Mitochondrial total GPx 			 			 			in vivo 			 			 			-SeH 			 			 			Adult mice 			 			 			Franco et al. 2009 			 		 		 			 			Total GPx 			 			 			in vitro 			 			 			-SeH 			 			 			SH-SY5Y cells 			 			 			Franco et al. 2009 			 		 		 			 			GPx1 and GPx4 			 			 			in vivo 			 			 			-SeH 			 			 			Adult mice 			 			 			Zemolin et al. 2012 			 		 		 			 			Total GPx 			 			 			in vivo 			 			 			-SeH 			 			 			Adult male mice 			 			 			Malagutti et al. 2009 			 		 		 			 			Total GPx 			 			 			in vitro 			 			 			-SeH 			 			 			PC12 cells 			 			 			Li et al. 2008 			 		 		 			 			Total GPx 			 			 			in vivo 			 			 			-SeH 			 			 			Mice gestational exposure 			 			 			Stringari et al. 2008 			 		 		 			 			Total GPx 			 			 			in vivo 			 			 			-SeH 			 			 			Adult rats 			 			 			Cheng et al. 2005 			 		 		 			 			Total GPx 			 			 			in vitro 			 			 			-SeH 			 			 			Fetal Telencepalic cells from rats 			 			 			Sorg et al. 1998 			 		 		 			 			Total GPx 			 			 			in vitro 			 			 			-SeH 			 			 			Mice neuroblastoma cells 			 			 			Kromidas et al. 1990 			 		 		 			 			Thioredoxin Reductase (TrxR) 			 			 			in vivo 			 			 			-SeH&nbsp; and &ndash;SH 			 			 			Adult mice 			 			 			Zemolin et al. 2012 			 		 		 			 			TrxR 			 			 			in vitro 			 			 			-SeH&nbsp; and &ndash;SH 			 			 			Adult mice 			 			 			Wagner et al. 2010 			 		 		 			 			TrxR 			 			 			in vivo 			 			 			-SeH-&nbsp; and &ndash;SH 			 			 			Adult rats 			 			 			Dalla Corte et al. 2013 			 		 		 			 			Mitochondrial total Gpx 			 			 			In vivo 			 			 			-SeH 			 			 			Adult rat 			 			 			Mori et al., 2007 			 		 		 			 			Mitochondrial total Gpx 			 			 			In vivo 			 			 			-SeH 			 			 			Adult Swiss male mice brain 			 			 			Franco et al., 2009 			 		 		 			&nbsp; 			&nbsp; 			&nbsp; 			&nbsp; 			&nbsp; 		 		 			 			Total brain TrxR 			 			 			In vivo 			 			 			-SeH and -SH 			 			 			Juvenile fish (zebra-seabreams) 			 			 			Branco et al. 2011  			Branco et al. 2012a,b 			 		 		 			&nbsp; 			&nbsp; 			&nbsp; 			&nbsp; 			&nbsp; 		 		 			 			Protein activity inhibited by Hg2+ 			 			 			&nbsp;  			exposure 			 			 			Functional group likely involved in the inhibition 			 			 			&nbsp;  			organism-preparation 			 			 			&nbsp; 			 		 		 			 			Total brain TrxR 			 			 			In vivo 			 			 			-SeH and -SH 			 			 			Juvenile fish (zebra-seabreams) 			 			 			Branco et al. 2012a,b 			 		 	   &nbsp;  Acrylamide   Acrylamide is an a,&beta;-unsaturated (conjugated) reactive molecule, which can react with thiol (-SH) and amino (-NH2) groups in proteins&nbsp; (LoPachin, 2004; LoPachin et al. 2007; 2009; 2011;&nbsp; Friedman, 2003; Bent et al. 2016; Martyniuk et al.2011; LoPachin and Gavin, 2014 ). However, the rate constant for the reaction between acrylamide with thiol/thiolate groups is much lower than that for MeHg.&nbsp; The rate of reaction of this compound with HMM-SH and LMM-SH is slow but can occur under physiological conditions (Tong et al. 2004; LoPachin, 2004). The inhibition of brain enzymes by acrylamide have been studied and the inhibition caused by acrylamide in some HMM-SH can be reversible&nbsp; (Howland et al. 1980). Despite of this, we can infer that some targets of MeHg and acrylamide can overlap, in particular GSH,where the rate constant for MeHg and acrylamide are &asymp;6.0 x 108 M-1.sec-1 and &asymp;0.15-2.1 x 10-2 M-1.sec-1, respectively (Yousef and Demerdash, 2006; Lapadula et al. 1989; Kopańska et al. 2015). Acrylamide can also be metabolized to an epoxide intermediate (glycidamide), which can also form adducts with cysteinyl residues in HMM-SH target proteins (Bergmark et al. 1991).  &nbsp;"@en ;

  dc:description "Because of the long latency of mammary tumors, the two-year rodent carcinogenicity bioassay is the primary assay for this adverse outcome. The assay is included in the OECD Test No. 451 and 453 for carcinogenicity and combined toxicity and carcinogenicity (OECD 2009; OECD 2009), and is also used by the US National Toxicology program (Chhabra, Huff et al. 1990), and the FDA (FDA (Food and Drug Administration) 2007), and referenced by the EPA (EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) 2005) in guidelines for risk assessments. Other assays from short term (2-4 weeks) and subchronic (90 day) to chronic (1 year) toxicity also call for the documentation of mammary tumors (FDA (Food and Drug Administration) 2007; OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) 2018), so these assays could capture the early onset of tumors, and could be modified to report earlier key events like proliferation and inflammation.  Several characteristics of classic cancer bioassays limit the sensitivity of these assays to mammary gland carcinogens. First, no assays require prenatal or early post-natal exposures for carcinogenicity testing. The US NIH&rsquo;s National Toxicology Program assays start exposures at five to six weeks of age and OECD regulatory assay exposures suggest (but do not require) exposures beginning after weaning and before eight weeks of age. Assays initiating exposures at later ages have diminished sensitivity to agents that affect breast development and increase future susceptibility to cancer, such as estrogenic hormones, DDT and dioxins (EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) 2005; Rudel, Fenton et al. 2011). Agents with similar activity to ionizing radiation and DNA damaging chemicals may not be fully captured in some of these assays, since sensitivity appears to peak around or before week seven for these agents (around puberty) (Imaoka, Nishimura et al. 2013). Second, carcinogenicity assay guidelines do not require the best methods for detecting tumors in mammary gland: whole mount preparations of mammary gland coupled with longitudinal sections (dorsoventral sections parallel to the body) of mammary gland for histology (Tucker, Foley et al. 2017). Palpation and transverse sections of mammary gland can easily miss tumors or lesions of interest. Interestingly the NTP reproductive toxicity guidelines do specify these preferable methods for mammary gland analysis.  Two additional factors affect the sensitivity of standard carcinogenicity assays. First, benign tumors are not always considered to be an indicator of carcinogenicity, leading to a possible underestimation of risk. &nbsp;NTP and EPA guidance suggest that benign tumors provide additional weight of evidence if malignant tumors are also present or if studies suggest benign tumors can progress to carcinogenicity. In a short-term study, benign tumors may indicate a need for a longer-term study. However, benign mammary tumors (fibroadenomas) almost always coincide with carcinogenic tumors in mammary gland or other organs, and carcinomas sometimes grow from fibroadnomas (Rudel, Attfield et al. 2007; Russo 2015) suggesting that benign tumors may be an underutilized indicator of carcinogenicity.  Finally, the dose selection guidance in carcinogenicity testing typically calls for a high dose that is sufficiently toxic to suppress body weight (OECD 2009). However, body weight interacts with risk of breast cancer (Haseman, Young et al. 1997; Rudel, Attfield et al. 2007), reducing the sensitivity of the upper end of the dose range and the likelihood of a positive dose-response."@en ;

  dc:description "Breast cancer imposes a significant burden on women worldwide and is an important target for prevention. It is the most common invasive cancer in women with the highest rates found in North America and Europe (Ervik, Lam et al. 2016), and incidence is increasing globally (Forouzanfar, Foreman et al. 2011). In the US, the National Cancer Institute estimates that the total number of new breast cancers will increase from 283,000 to 441,000 between 2011 and 2030 (Rosenberg, Barker et al. 2015). Twin studies suggest that heritable factors explain at most a third of breast cancers and around 60% of all cancers are related to avoidable factors (Ronckers, Erdmann et al. 2005; Colditz and Wei 2012; Moller, Mucci et al. 2016), leaving significant room for prevention efforts focused on environmental factors to reduce new cases. Well-documented risk factors include tobacco and alcohol use as well as obesity, physical activity, and exposure to carcinogens (Colditz and Wei 2012).  &nbsp;  Breast cancer incidence and risk varies with age, and hormonal and reproductive factors. Incidence increases with age, with rates among women increasing rapidly after age 30 and peaking around 75 years of age (NCI SEER 2016). Incidence is strongly influenced by the reproductive hormones estrogen and progesterone and by childbirth, which influence the proliferation and number of cells in the breast (Gertig, Stillman et al. 1999; Ronckers, Erdmann et al. 2005; Bijwaard, Brenner et al. 2010; Dall, Risbridger et al. 2017). Breast cancer risk increases with earlier puberty or later menopause (CGHFBC 2012; Bodicoat, Schoemaker et al. 2014), factors that increase cumulative estrogen and progesterone exposure and the number of proliferative menstrual cycles in the breast. Conversely, risk decreases in women with ovariectomies (Olson, Sellers et al. 2004; Press, Sullivan-Halley et al. 2011) and with menopause (CGHFBC 2012). Risk also decreases with number of pregnancies, breastfeeding, and increasing time since childbirth. This decrease in risk is thought to be related to the differentiation of stem cells in the breast during pregnancy and lactation and the decline in epithelial cell number after childbirth (Gertig, Stillman et al. 1999; Dall, Risbridger et al. 2017). Breast cancer incidence in men is less than 1% that of women, a difference attributed to low levels of estrogen and progesterone and few breast epithelial cells (Stang and Thomssen 2008).  &nbsp;  Bijwaard, H., A.

  dc:description "Because of the long latency of mammary tumors, the two-year rodent carcinogenicity bioassay is the primary assay for this adverse outcome. The assay is included in the OECD Test No. 451 and 453 for carcinogenicity and combined toxicity and carcinogenicity (OECD 2009; OECD 2009), and is also used by the US National Toxicology program (Chhabra, Huff et al. 1990), and the FDA (FDA (Food and Drug Administration) 2007), and referenced by the EPA (EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) 2005) in guidelines for risk assessments. Other assays from short term (2-4 weeks) and subchronic (90 day) to chronic (1 year) toxicity also call for the documentation of mammary tumors (FDA (Food and Drug Administration) 2007; OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) 2018), so these assays could capture the early onset of tumors, and could be modified to report earlier key events like proliferation and inflammation.  Several characteristics of classic cancer bioassays limit the sensitivity of these assays to mammary gland carcinogens. First, no assays require prenatal or early post-natal exposures for carcinogenicity testing. The US NIH&rsquo;s National Toxicology Program assays start exposures at five to six weeks of age and OECD regulatory assay exposures suggest (but do not require) exposures beginning after weaning and before eight weeks of age. Assays initiating exposures at later ages have diminished sensitivity to agents that affect breast development and increase future susceptibility to cancer, such as estrogenic hormones, DDT and dioxins (EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) 2005; Rudel, Fenton et al. 2011). Agents with similar activity to ionizing radiation and DNA damaging chemicals may not be fully captured in some of these assays, since sensitivity appears to peak around or before week seven for these agents (around puberty) (Imaoka, Nishimura et al. 2013). Second, carcinogenicity assay guidelines do not require the best methods for detecting tumors in mammary gland: whole mount preparations of mammary gland coupled with longitudinal sections (dorsoventral sections parallel to the body) of mammary gland for histology (Tucker, Foley et al. 2017). Palpation and transverse sections of mammary gland can easily miss tumors or lesions of interest. Interestingly the NTP reproductive toxicity guidelines do specify these preferable methods for mammary gland analysis.  Two additional factors affect the sensitivity of standard carcinogenicity assays. First, benign tumors are not always considered to be an indicator of carcinogenicity, leading to a possible underestimation of risk. &nbsp;NTP and EPA guidance suggest that benign tumors provide additional weight of evidence if malignant tumors are also present or if studies suggest benign tumors can progress to carcinogenicity.

The OECD test guideline alkaline comet assay Test No. 489 (OECD 2016) detects single and double strand breaks, including those arising from repair as well as some (alkali sensitive) nucleotide lesions including some lesions from oxidative damage. OECD tests for chromosomal damage and micronuclei Test No. 473, 475, 483, and 487 measure longer term effects of DNA damage but these tests require the damaged cell to subsequently undergo replication (OECD 2016; OECD 2016; OECD 2016; OECD 2016).&nbsp; They can therefore reflect a wider range of sources of DNA damage including changes in mitosis."@en ;

  dc:description "Breast cancer imposes a significant burden on women worldwide and is an important target for prevention. It is the most common invasive cancer in women with the highest rates found in North America and Europe (Ervik, Lam et al. 2016), and incidence is increasing globally (Forouzanfar, Foreman et al. 2011). In the US, the National Cancer Institute estimates that the total number of new breast cancers will increase from 283,000 to 441,000 between 2011 and 2030 (Rosenberg, Barker et al. 2015). Twin studies suggest that heritable factors explain at most a third of breast cancers and around 60% of all cancers are related to avoidable factors (Ronckers, Erdmann et al. 2005; Colditz and Wei 2012; Moller, Mucci et al. 2016), leaving significant room for prevention efforts focused on environmental factors to reduce new cases. Well-documented risk factors include tobacco and alcohol use as well as obesity, physical activity, and exposure to carcinogens (Colditz and Wei 2012).  &nbsp;  Breast cancer incidence and risk varies with age, and hormonal and reproductive factors. Incidence increases with age, with rates among women increasing rapidly after age 30 and peaking around 75 years of age (NCI SEER 2016). Incidence is strongly influenced by the reproductive hormones estrogen and progesterone and by childbirth, which influence the proliferation and number of cells in the breast (Gertig, Stillman et al. 1999; Ronckers, Erdmann et al. 2005; Bijwaard, Brenner et al. 2010; Dall, Risbridger et al. 2017). Breast cancer risk increases with earlier puberty or later menopause (CGHFBC 2012; Bodicoat, Schoemaker et al. 2014), factors that increase cumulative estrogen and progesterone exposure and the number of proliferative menstrual cycles in the breast. Conversely, risk decreases in women with ovariectomies (Olson, Sellers et al. 2004; Press, Sullivan-Halley et al. 2011) and with menopause (CGHFBC 2012). Risk also decreases with number of pregnancies, breastfeeding, and increasing time since childbirth. This decrease in risk is thought to be related to the differentiation of stem cells in the breast during pregnancy and lactation and the decline in epithelial cell number after childbirth (Gertig, Stillman et al. 1999; Dall, Risbridger et al. 2017). Breast cancer incidence in men is less than 1% that of women, a difference attributed to low levels of estrogen and progesterone and few breast epithelial cells (Stang and Thomssen 2008).  &nbsp;  Bijwaard, H., A.

  dc:description "Because of the long latency of mammary tumors, the two-year rodent carcinogenicity bioassay is the primary assay for this adverse outcome. The assay is included in the OECD Test No. 451 and 453 for carcinogenicity and combined toxicity and carcinogenicity (OECD 2009; OECD 2009), and is also used by the US National Toxicology program (Chhabra, Huff et al. 1990), and the FDA (FDA (Food and Drug Administration) 2007), and referenced by the EPA (EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) 2005) in guidelines for risk assessments. Other assays from short term (2-4 weeks) and subchronic (90 day) to chronic (1 year) toxicity also call for the documentation of mammary tumors (FDA (Food and Drug Administration) 2007; OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) 2018), so these assays could capture the early onset of tumors, and could be modified to report earlier key events like proliferation and inflammation.  Several characteristics of classic cancer bioassays limit the sensitivity of these assays to mammary gland carcinogens. First, no assays require prenatal or early post-natal exposures for carcinogenicity testing. The US NIH&rsquo;s National Toxicology Program assays start exposures at five to six weeks of age and OECD regulatory assay exposures suggest (but do not require) exposures beginning after weaning and before eight weeks of age. Assays initiating exposures at later ages have diminished sensitivity to agents that affect breast development and increase future susceptibility to cancer, such as estrogenic hormones, DDT and dioxins (EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) 2005; Rudel, Fenton et al. 2011). Agents with similar activity to ionizing radiation and DNA damaging chemicals may not be fully captured in some of these assays, since sensitivity appears to peak around or before week seven for these agents (around puberty) (Imaoka, Nishimura et al. 2013). Second, carcinogenicity assay guidelines do not require the best methods for detecting tumors in mammary gland: whole mount preparations of mammary gland coupled with longitudinal sections (dorsoventral sections parallel to the body) of mammary gland for histology (Tucker, Foley et al. 2017). Palpation and transverse sections of mammary gland can easily miss tumors or lesions of interest. Interestingly the NTP reproductive toxicity guidelines do specify these preferable methods for mammary gland analysis.  Two additional factors affect the sensitivity of standard carcinogenicity assays. First, benign tumors are not always considered to be an indicator of carcinogenicity, leading to a possible underestimation of risk. &nbsp;NTP and EPA guidance suggest that benign tumors provide additional weight of evidence if malignant tumors are also present or if studies suggest benign tumors can progress to carcinogenicity. In a short-term study, benign tumors may indicate a need for a longer-term study. However, benign mammary tumors (fibroadenomas) almost always coincide with carcinogenic tumors in mammary gland or other organs, and carcinomas sometimes grow from fibroadnomas (Rudel, Attfield et al. 2007; Russo 2015) suggesting that benign tumors may be an underutilized indicator of carcinogenicity.  Finally, the dose selection guidance in carcinogenicity testing typically calls for a high dose that is sufficiently toxic to suppress body weight (OECD 2009). However, body weight interacts with risk of breast cancer (Haseman, Young et al. 1997; Rudel, Attfield et al. 2007), reducing the sensitivity of the upper end of the dose range and the likelihood of a positive dose-response."@en ;

  dc:description "Because of the long latency of mammary tumors, the two-year rodent carcinogenicity bioassay is the primary assay for this adverse outcome. The assay is included in the OECD Test No. 451 and 453 for carcinogenicity and combined toxicity and carcinogenicity (OECD 2009; OECD 2009), and is also used by the US National Toxicology program (Chhabra, Huff et al. 1990), and the FDA (FDA (Food and Drug Administration) 2007), and referenced by the EPA (EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) 2005) in guidelines for risk assessments. Other assays from short term (2-4 weeks) and subchronic (90 day) to chronic (1 year) toxicity also call for the documentation of mammary tumors (FDA (Food and Drug Administration) 2007; OECD (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) 2018), so these assays could capture the early onset of tumors, and could be modified to report earlier key events like proliferation and inflammation.  Several characteristics of classic cancer bioassays limit the sensitivity of these assays to mammary gland carcinogens. First, no assays require prenatal or early post-natal exposures for carcinogenicity testing. The US NIH&rsquo;s National Toxicology Program assays start exposures at five to six weeks of age and OECD regulatory assay exposures suggest (but do not require) exposures beginning after weaning and before eight weeks of age. Assays initiating exposures at later ages have diminished sensitivity to agents that affect breast development and increase future susceptibility to cancer, such as estrogenic hormones, DDT and dioxins (EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) 2005; Rudel, Fenton et al. 2011). Agents with similar activity to ionizing radiation and DNA damaging chemicals may not be fully captured in some of these assays, since sensitivity appears to peak around or before week seven for these agents (around puberty) (Imaoka, Nishimura et al. 2013). Second, carcinogenicity assay guidelines do not require the best methods for detecting tumors in mammary gland: whole mount preparations of mammary gland coupled with longitudinal sections (dorsoventral sections parallel to the body) of mammary gland for histology (Tucker, Foley et al. 2017). Palpation and transverse sections of mammary gland can easily miss tumors or lesions of interest. Interestingly the NTP reproductive toxicity guidelines do specify these preferable methods for mammary gland analysis.  Two additional factors affect the sensitivity of standard carcinogenicity assays. First, benign tumors are not always considered to be an indicator of carcinogenicity, leading to a possible underestimation of risk. &nbsp;NTP and EPA guidance suggest that benign tumors provide additional weight of evidence if malignant tumors are also present or if studies suggest benign tumors can progress to carcinogenicity. In a short-term study, benign tumors may indicate a need for a longer-term study. However, benign mammary tumors (fibroadenomas) almost always coincide with carcinogenic tumors in mammary gland or other organs, and carcinomas sometimes grow from fibroadnomas (Rudel, Attfield et al. 2007; Russo 2015) suggesting that benign tumors may be an underutilized indicator of carcinogenicity.  Finally, the dose selection guidance in carcinogenicity testing typically calls for a high dose that is sufficiently toxic to suppress body weight (OECD 2009). However, body weight interacts with risk of breast cancer (Haseman, Young et al. 1997; Rudel, Attfield et al. 2007), reducing the sensitivity of the upper end of the dose range and the likelihood of a positive dose-response."@en ;

  dc:description "DNA damage increases the susceptibility to and probability of subsequent mutations, described in the key event &lsquo;Increase in Mutation&rsquo;. Mutations&nbsp;can impair the functional capacity of the cell and are an endpoint of regulator significance&nbsp;in their own right.  Multiple guideline toxicity tests exist for DNA damage. The OECD test guideline for DNA synthesis Test No. 486 (OECD 1997) detects nucleotide excision repair, so it will reflect the formation of bulky DNA adducts but not the majority of oxidative damage to nucleotides, which is typically repaired via the Base Excision Repair pathway. The OECD test guideline alkaline comet assay Test No. 489 (OECD 2016) detects single and double strand breaks, including those arising from repair as well as some (alkali sensitive) nucleotide lesions including some lesions from oxidative damage. OECD tests for chromosomal damage and micronuclei Test No. 473, 475, 483, and 487 measure longer term effects of DNA damage but these tests require the damaged cell to subsequently undergo replication (OECD 2016; OECD 2016; OECD 2016; OECD 2016).&nbsp; They can therefore reflect a wider range of sources of DNA damage including changes in mitosis."@en ;

  dc:description "Breast cancer imposes a significant burden on women worldwide and is an important target for prevention. It is the most common invasive cancer in women with the highest rates found in North America and Europe (Ervik, Lam et al. 2016), and incidence is increasing globally (Forouzanfar, Foreman et al. 2011). In the US, the National Cancer Institute estimates that the total number of new breast cancers will increase from 283,000 to 441,000 between 2011 and 2030 (Rosenberg, Barker et al. 2015). Twin studies suggest that heritable factors explain at most a third of breast cancers and around 60% of all cancers are related to avoidable factors (Ronckers, Erdmann et al. 2005; Colditz and Wei 2012; Moller, Mucci et al. 2016), leaving significant room for prevention efforts focused on environmental factors to reduce new cases. Well-documented risk factors include tobacco and alcohol use as well as obesity, physical activity, and exposure to carcinogens (Colditz and Wei 2012).  &nbsp;  Breast cancer incidence and risk varies with age, and hormonal and reproductive factors. Incidence increases with age, with rates among women increasing rapidly after age 30 and peaking around 75 years of age (NCI SEER 2016). Incidence is strongly influenced by the reproductive hormones estrogen and progesterone and by childbirth, which influence the proliferation and number of cells in the breast (Gertig, Stillman et al. 1999; Ronckers, Erdmann et al. 2005; Bijwaard, Brenner et al. 2010; Dall, Risbridger et al. 2017). Breast cancer risk increases with earlier puberty or later menopause (CGHFBC 2012; Bodicoat, Schoemaker et al. 2014), factors that increase cumulative estrogen and progesterone exposure and the number of proliferative menstrual cycles in the breast. Conversely, risk decreases in women with ovariectomies (Olson, Sellers et al. 2004; Press, Sullivan-Halley et al. 2011) and with menopause (CGHFBC 2012). Risk also decreases with number of pregnancies, breastfeeding, and increasing time since childbirth. This decrease in risk is thought to be related to the differentiation of stem cells in the breast during pregnancy and lactation and the decline in epithelial cell number after childbirth (Gertig, Stillman et al. 1999; Dall, Risbridger et al. 2017). Breast cancer incidence in men is less than 1% that of women, a difference attributed to low levels of estrogen and progesterone and few breast epithelial cells (Stang and Thomssen 2008).  &nbsp;  Bijwaard, H., A.

  dc:description "This AOP network describes oxidative damage to DNA (MIE) leading to mutations (AO1) and chromosomal aberrations (AO2). The AOP summarizes the evidence supporting&nbsp;how increases in oxidative DNA lesions can overwhelm DNA repair mechanisms, causing an accumulation of unrepaired lesions and/or repair intermediates. Failure to resolve oxidative DNA damage can lead to permanent alterations to&nbsp;the genome. Increases in reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS)&nbsp;that can lead to oxidative DNA lesions is a broad characteristic&nbsp;of many xenobiotics and indeed, is noted as one of the &#39;key characteristics of carcinogens&#39; (Smith et al., 2016). Moreover,&nbsp;oxidative stress is often suspected to be the cause of DNA damage by substances whose mechanism of genotoxicity is uncertain [e.g., glyphosate (Kier and Kirkland, 2013; Benbrook, 2019), monosodium glutamate (Ataseven et al., 2016)]. Thus, this AOP network&nbsp;will serve as a key tool in mechanism-based genotoxic hazard identification and assessment.  Oxidative stress describes&nbsp;an imbalance of oxidants and antioxidants in the cell. Oxidative stress can occur when free radicals overwhelm the antioxidant capacity under certain physiological conditions, such as inflammation due to diseases, and also through exogenous stressors that are oxidants and/or induce ROS and other free radicals. Excess oxidants can occur following&nbsp;exposure to agents that: (a) generate free radicals and other RONS, (b) deplete cellular antioxidants, and/or (c)&nbsp;have oxidizing properties (Parke, 1982). Furthermore, there are substances that can induce&nbsp;inflammatory responses&nbsp;and in turn cause oxidative stress as a secondary effect (Gustafson et al., 2016).&nbsp;The effects of oxidative stress in the cell are broad; all biomolecules are susceptible to damage by oxidizing agents. Oxidative stress and associated damage to cellular components have been implicated in various diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and different cancers (Liguori et al., 2018).&nbsp;  Free radicals and other RONS are continuously generated as by-products of endogenous redox reactions (e.g., oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria, NADPH oxidation to NADP+ by NADPH oxidase) at steady state. The steady state concentration of oxidants is essential for cellular functions (e.g., as secondary signalling molecules) and is tightly regulated by endogenous antioxidants such as glutathione, and antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase. There are many protective barriers against oxidative damage to the genome within the cell. Compartmentalization is one of the ways in which DNA is protected from exposure to ROS and other free radicals generated by various biological processes that occur in different parts of the cell. Examples include CYP450 enzyme activity in the cytoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria (Dan Dunn et al., 2015; Veith and Moorthy, 2019).  Exogenous sources such as ionizing radiation, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and certain compounds can directly or indirectly generate reactive species, causing oxidative stress. Oxidizing compounds can also directly cause oxidative damage to cellular components (Liguori et al., 2018). The nitrogenous bases of the DNA are susceptible to oxidation by both endogenous and exogenous oxidants (Berquist and Wilson III, 2012). Oxidizing agents cause a wide range of oxidative DNA lesions. In addition to strand breaks due to direct RONS attack on the phosphate backbone, the nitrogenous bases can be modified in various ways by free radicals and other reactive species. If these lesions are left unrepaired or the attempt at repair fails, mutations and strand breaks can occur, permanently altering the DNA sequence. All nitrogenous bases are susceptible to oxidative damage, however, to different extents. A variety of DNA lesions caused by RONS are described within this AOP ADDIN RW.CITE{{342 Cooke,M. 2003}}(Cooke et al., 2003). Notably, guanine is most readily damaged by RONS and other oxidants due to its low reduction potential. Indeed,&nbsp;8-oxoG is the most abundant oxidative DNA lesion and has been extensively studied.&nbsp;Consequently,&nbsp;chromosomal regions containing a higher GC content are more susceptible to oxidative base modifications. For example, human telomeres, which are constituted by TTAGGG repeats and a single-stranded G-rich 3&#39; overhang, are known to be comparatively more sensitive to oxidative damage than other regions in the genome&nbsp;and accumulate 8-oxodG lesions that eventually lead to telomere shortening and genomic instability (Petersen et al., 1998; Bolzan, 2012;&nbsp;Fouquerel et al., 2019).&nbsp;The repair mechanisms and consequences of oxidative damage to&nbsp;telomeres&nbsp;are&nbsp;active areas of research.&nbsp;  Within this AOP network, we mainly focus on 8-oxo-dG as oxidative DNA damage representing the MIE, for practicality.&nbsp;The fate of guanine lesions has been most extensively researched and well understood ADDIN RW.CITE{{300 Whitaker,A. 2017; 370 Cadet,J. 2017; 318 Markkanen,E. 2017; 139 Roszkowski,K. 2011}}(Roszkowski et al., 2011; Whitaker et al., 2017; Cadet et al., 2017; Markkanen, 2017). Also,&nbsp;8-oxodG is an accepted biomarker of oxidative stress and oxidative damage to DNA both&nbsp;in vitro&nbsp;and in vivo&nbsp;(Cooke et al., 2008; Roszkowski et al., 2011; P. Li et al., 2014; Guo et al., 2017). Several different detection methods for 8-oxo-dG are commercially available and, thus, are easy to access (e.g., immunodetection, comet assay). We note that 8-oxo-dG is not a terminal product of oxidative damage; 8-oxo-dG can be further oxidized to additional mutagenic lesions such as spiroiminodihydantoin and guanidinohydantoin ADDIN RW.CITE{{488 Jena,N.R. 2012}}(Jena and Mishra, 2012). However, as with many other oxidative lesions on pyrimidines and adenine, these guanine lesions are estimated to be small fractions compared to 8-oxo-dG&nbsp;(Yu et al., 2005; Cooke et al., 2008).&nbsp;  The pathway to mutations (AO1) from oxidative DNA lesions&nbsp;can either proceed (a) directly to mutation through replication of unrepaired oxidized DNA bases (insertion of an incorrect nucleotide by a replicative or translesion polymerase), or (b) indirectly through the creation of strand breaks that can be misrepaired to introduce mutations ADDIN RW.CITE{{346 Rodgers,K. 2016; 323 Taggart,D. 2014}}(Taggart et al., 2014; Rodgers and McVey, 2016). Strand breaks can arise during attempted repair of oxidative DNA lesions. Oxidative base damage is predominantly repaired by base excision repair (BER), and&nbsp;by nucleotide excision repair (NER) to&nbsp;a lesser extent (Whitaker et al., 2017). In the excision repair pathways, single strand breaks (SSB) are transiently introduced as repair intermediates. With increasing oxidative lesions and more lesions in close proximity to each other, the quality and efficiency of repair may be compromised, resulting in&nbsp;persistent unrepaired lesions and repair intermediates. Accumulated repair intermediates such as&nbsp;SSBs,&nbsp;oxidized bases, and abasic sites can interfere with proximal excision repair and/or&nbsp;impede replication fork elongation, leading&nbsp;to double strand breaks (DSBs), which are more toxic and&nbsp;difficult to repair ADDIN RW.CITE{{261 Yang,N. 2006; 340 Ensminger,M. 2014; 450 Sedletska,Y. 2013}}(Yang et al., 2006; Sedletska et al., 2013; Ensminger et al., 2014). Furthermore, if a SSB is introduced nearby another SSB on the opposite strand prior to or&nbsp;during excision repair, these SSBs may be converted to DSBs. Some studies suggest&nbsp;that multiple DNA lesions within one or two helical turns can increase the rate of DSB formation (Cannan and Pederson, 2017). Insufficiently repaired DSBs (incorrect or lack of rejoining) can permanently alter the DNA sequence (e.g., insertion, deletion, translocations), and cause both mutations (AO1) and structural chromosomal aberrations (AO2) ADDIN RW.CITE{{346 Rodgers,K. 2016}}(Rodgers and McVey, 2016). These processes are described in more detail within the AOP. &nbsp;&nbsp;  Overall, we anticipate that this AOP network will provide a key sub-network that will be relevant to many future AOPs. However, we note that the AOs herein, increased mutations and chromosomal aberrations, are regulatory endpoints of concern in and of themselves.

  dc:description "This AOP network describes oxidative damage to DNA (MIE) leading to mutations (AO1) and chromosomal aberrations (AO2). The AOP summarizes the evidence supporting&nbsp;how increases in oxidative DNA lesions can overwhelm DNA repair mechanisms, causing an accumulation of unrepaired lesions and/or repair intermediates. Failure to resolve oxidative DNA damage can lead to permanent alterations to&nbsp;the genome. Increases in reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS)&nbsp;that can lead to oxidative DNA lesions is a broad characteristic&nbsp;of many xenobiotics and indeed, is noted as one of the &#39;key characteristics of carcinogens&#39; (Smith et al., 2016). Moreover,&nbsp;oxidative stress is often suspected to be the cause of DNA damage by substances whose mechanism of genotoxicity is uncertain [e.g., glyphosate (Kier and Kirkland, 2013; Benbrook, 2019), monosodium glutamate (Ataseven et al., 2016)]. Thus, this AOP network&nbsp;will serve as a key tool in mechanism-based genotoxic hazard identification and assessment.  Oxidative stress describes&nbsp;an imbalance of oxidants and antioxidants in the cell. Oxidative stress can occur when free radicals overwhelm the antioxidant capacity under certain physiological conditions, such as inflammation due to diseases, and also through exogenous stressors that are oxidants and/or induce ROS and other free radicals. Excess oxidants can occur following&nbsp;exposure to agents that: (a) generate free radicals and other RONS, (b) deplete cellular antioxidants, and/or (c)&nbsp;have oxidizing properties (Parke, 1982). Furthermore, there are substances that can induce&nbsp;inflammatory responses&nbsp;and in turn cause oxidative stress as a secondary effect (Gustafson et al., 2016).&nbsp;The effects of oxidative stress in the cell are broad; all biomolecules are susceptible to damage by oxidizing agents. Oxidative stress and associated damage to cellular components have been implicated in various diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and different cancers (Liguori et al., 2018).&nbsp;  Free radicals and other RONS are continuously generated as by-products of endogenous redox reactions (e.g., oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria, NADPH oxidation to NADP+ by NADPH oxidase) at steady state. The steady state concentration of oxidants is essential for cellular functions (e.g., as secondary signalling molecules) and is tightly regulated by endogenous antioxidants such as glutathione, and antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and catalase. There are many protective barriers against oxidative damage to the genome within the cell. Compartmentalization is one of the ways in which DNA is protected from exposure to ROS and other free radicals generated by various biological processes that occur in different parts of the cell. Examples include CYP450 enzyme activity in the cytoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria (Dan Dunn et al., 2015; Veith and Moorthy, 2019).  Exogenous sources such as ionizing radiation, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and certain compounds can directly or indirectly generate reactive species, causing oxidative stress. Oxidizing compounds can also directly cause oxidative damage to cellular components (Liguori et al., 2018). The nitrogenous bases of the DNA are susceptible to oxidation by both endogenous and exogenous oxidants (Berquist and Wilson III, 2012). Oxidizing agents cause a wide range of oxidative DNA lesions. In addition to strand breaks due to direct RONS attack on the phosphate backbone, the nitrogenous bases can be modified in various ways by free radicals and other reactive species. If these lesions are left unrepaired or the attempt at repair fails, mutations and strand breaks can occur, permanently altering the DNA sequence. All nitrogenous bases are susceptible to oxidative damage, however, to different extents. A variety of DNA lesions caused by RONS are described within this AOP ADDIN RW.CITE{{342 Cooke,M. 2003}}(Cooke et al., 2003). Notably, guanine is most readily damaged by RONS and other oxidants due to its low reduction potential. Indeed,&nbsp;8-oxoG is the most abundant oxidative DNA lesion and has been extensively studied.&nbsp;Consequently,&nbsp;chromosomal regions containing a higher GC content are more susceptible to oxidative base modifications. For example, human telomeres, which are constituted by TTAGGG repeats and a single-stranded G-rich 3&#39; overhang, are known to be comparatively more sensitive to oxidative damage than other regions in the genome&nbsp;and accumulate 8-oxodG lesions that eventually lead to telomere shortening and genomic instability (Petersen et al., 1998; Bolzan, 2012;&nbsp;Fouquerel et al., 2019).&nbsp;The repair mechanisms and consequences of oxidative damage to&nbsp;telomeres&nbsp;are&nbsp;active areas of research.&nbsp;  Within this AOP network, we mainly focus on 8-oxo-dG as oxidative DNA damage representing the MIE, for practicality.&nbsp;The fate of guanine lesions has been most extensively researched and well understood ADDIN RW.CITE{{300 Whitaker,A. 2017; 370 Cadet,J. 2017; 318 Markkanen,E. 2017; 139 Roszkowski,K. 2011}}(Roszkowski et al., 2011; Whitaker et al., 2017; Cadet et al., 2017; Markkanen, 2017). Also,&nbsp;8-oxodG is an accepted biomarker of oxidative stress and oxidative damage to DNA both&nbsp;in vitro&nbsp;and in vivo&nbsp;(Cooke et al., 2008; Roszkowski et al., 2011; P. Li et al., 2014; Guo et al., 2017). Several different detection methods for 8-oxo-dG are commercially available and, thus, are easy to access (e.g., immunodetection, comet assay). We note that 8-oxo-dG is not a terminal product of oxidative damage; 8-oxo-dG can be further oxidized to additional mutagenic lesions such as spiroiminodihydantoin and guanidinohydantoin ADDIN RW.CITE{{488 Jena,N.R. 2012}}(Jena and Mishra, 2012). However, as with many other oxidative lesions on pyrimidines and adenine, these guanine lesions are estimated to be small fractions compared to 8-oxo-dG&nbsp;(Yu et al., 2005; Cooke et al., 2008).&nbsp;  The pathway to mutations (AO1) from oxidative DNA lesions&nbsp;can either proceed (a) directly to mutation through replication of unrepaired oxidized DNA bases (insertion of an incorrect nucleotide by a replicative or translesion polymerase), or (b) indirectly through the creation of strand breaks that can be misrepaired to introduce mutations ADDIN RW.CITE{{346 Rodgers,K. 2016; 323 Taggart,D. 2014}}(Taggart et al., 2014; Rodgers and McVey, 2016). Strand breaks can arise during attempted repair of oxidative DNA lesions. Oxidative base damage is predominantly repaired by base excision repair (BER), and&nbsp;by nucleotide excision repair (NER) to&nbsp;a lesser extent (Whitaker et al., 2017). In the excision repair pathways, single strand breaks (SSB) are transiently introduced as repair intermediates. With increasing oxidative lesions and more lesions in close proximity to each other, the quality and efficiency of repair may be compromised, resulting in&nbsp;persistent unrepaired lesions and repair intermediates. Accumulated repair intermediates such as&nbsp;SSBs,&nbsp;oxidized bases, and abasic sites can interfere with proximal excision repair and/or&nbsp;impede replication fork elongation, leading&nbsp;to double strand breaks (DSBs), which are more toxic and&nbsp;difficult to repair ADDIN RW.CITE{{261 Yang,N. 2006; 340 Ensminger,M. 2014; 450 Sedletska,Y. 2013}}(Yang et al., 2006; Sedletska et al., 2013; Ensminger et al., 2014). Furthermore, if a SSB is introduced nearby another SSB on the opposite strand prior to or&nbsp;during excision repair, these SSBs may be converted to DSBs. Some studies suggest&nbsp;that multiple DNA lesions within one or two helical turns can increase the rate of DSB formation (Cannan and Pederson, 2017). Insufficiently repaired DSBs (incorrect or lack of rejoining) can permanently alter the DNA sequence (e.g., insertion, deletion, translocations), and cause both mutations (AO1) and structural chromosomal aberrations (AO2) ADDIN RW.CITE{{346 Rodgers,K. 2016}}(Rodgers and McVey, 2016). These processes are described in more detail within the AOP. &nbsp;&nbsp;  Overall, we anticipate that this AOP network will provide a key sub-network that will be relevant to many future AOPs. However, we note that the AOs herein, increased mutations and chromosomal aberrations, are regulatory endpoints of concern in and of themselves. This AOP also provides a template for designing testing strategies for RONS-induced genetic effects. Despite the fact that this is a long-studied area in genetic toxicology, this work highlights notable gaps in the empirical evidence linking adjacent KEs. For example, the extent to which the levels of oxidative DNA damage must increase before DNA repair processes are overwhelmed&nbsp;leading to an&nbsp;AO is currently poorly understood, and may vary based on the test system. Hence, further data are needed to improve our ability to predict whether this pathway is relevant to a chemical&rsquo;s toxicological effects.."@en ;

  dc:description "This adverse outcome pathway (AOP) represents the potential causative adverse outcomes (AOs) by inhibition of retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (RALDH), which is one of the crucial enzymes participating in retinol metabolism. The role of RALDH in retinol metabolism is to catalyze the chemical reaction converting retinal to retinoic acid (RA). The synthesized RA is associated with the cellular RA-binding protein (CRABP) and enters into the nucleus, and then bind to retinoic acid receptors (RARs) along with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) (Vilhais-Neto and Pourqui&eacute;, 2008). The activated RARs and RXRs can act as target gene transcription factors regulating embryonic development in fishes (Perz-Edwards et al., 2011). Inhibition of RALDH can be caused by chemical inhibitors such as Disulphiram, Citral, Paclobutrazol, Diethylaminobenzaldehyde, Nitrofen, 4-biphenyl carboxylic acid, Bisdiamine, SB-210661 and etc. (Marsh-Armstrong et al., 1994; Chawla et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2017; Le et al., 2012; Mey et al., 2003). RALDH inhibition, the molecular initiating event (MIE) for this AOP, leads to decreased RA synthesis blocking the reaction converting retinal to RA in embryonic cells (Hyatt and Dowling, 1997; Molotkov et al., 2002; Le et al., 2012; Duester, 2009). Since RA is an essential activator for the RARs and RXRs-mediated gene transcription, low level of plasma RA leads to abnormal development in embryonic cells. A number of previous studies well-elucidated the abnormal developments by RA inhibition including visual function and eye development (Duester et al., 2009; Hyatt and Dowling, 1997; Hyatt et al., 1996; Kam et al., 2012; Le et al., 2012; Luo et al., 2006; Marsh-Armstrong et al., 1994; Matt et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2017), intestinal development (Nadauld et al., 2005), brain patterning and neurogenesis (Begemann et al., 2004; Niederreither and Doll&eacute;, 2008; Samarut et al., 2015), and heart development (Niederreither and Doll&eacute;, 2008; Samarut et al., 2015). The development of early embryonic cells of fishes plays an essential role in the organism&rsquo;s young of year survival and adaptation in fluctuated environmental condition. The impact of the development of the optical elements of the eye by RALDH inhibition in fish population trajectory has not been clarified yet, although the importance of the visual function of fishes previously mentioned by previous studies (Fernald, 1984; Sandstr&ouml;m, 1999).

  dc:description "It is well documented that ionizing radiation( (eg.&nbsp;X-rays, gamma, photons, alpha, beta, neutrons, heavy ions)&nbsp;leads to energy deposition on the atoms and molecules of the substrate. Many studies, have demonstrated that the type of radiation and distance from source has an impact on the pattern of energy deposition (Alloni, et al. 2014). High linear energy transfer (LET) radiation has been associated with higher-energy deposits (Liamsuwan et al., 2014) that are more densely-packed and cause more complex effects within the particle track (Hada and Georgakilas, 2008; Okayasu, 2012ab; Lorat et al., 2015; Nikitaki et al., 2016) in comparison to low LET radiation. Parameters such as mean lineal energy, dose mean lineal energy, frequency mean specific energy and dose mean specific energy can impact track structure of the traversed energy into a medium (Friedland et al., 2017). The detection of energy deposition by ionizing radiation can be demonstrated with the use of fluorescent nuclear track detectors (FNTDs). FNTDs used in conjunction with fluorescent microscopy, are able to visualize radiation tracks produced by ionizing radiation (Niklas et al., 2013; Kodaira et al., 2015; Sawakuchi and Akselrod, 2016). In addition, these FNTD chips can quantify the LET of primary and secondary radiation tracks up to 0.47 keV/um (Sawakuchi and Akselrod, 2016). This co-visualization of the radiation tracks and the cell markers enable the mapping of the radiation trajectory to specific cellular compartments, and the identification of accrued damage (Niklas et al., 2013; Kodaira et al., 2015).

  dc:description "Numerous hydrophobic, amphipathic compounds are known to inhibit the proton pumping NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, also known as the ubiquinone reductase reaction of respiratory chain complex I (Fendel et al., 2008). However, the most studied examples of chemicals that inhibit CI are: rotenone and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) (Desplats et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2012; Sava et al., 2007). Both, rotenone (pesticide) and MPP+ (the active metabolite of MPTP) are well known to reproduce the anatomical, neurochemical, behavioural and neuropathological features of PD-like syndrome (Betarbet et al., 200; Greenamyre et al., 2001). Indeed, an overwhelming evidence has accumulated in the existing literature suggesting such a link and therefore these two inhibitors of CI will be discussed in the context of all KE identified in this AOP.  1. Rotenone affinity to complex I binding sites.  Rotenone (a flavonoid, extracted from the several plants e.g. Derris scandens)is one of the most powerful, an irreversible inhibitor of CI, binding with high affinity to CI and is typically used to define the specific activity of this complex. Rotenone is extremely lipophilic, it crosses biological membrane easily and it gets into brain very rapidly. Rotenone inhibits 20 kDa subunit of complex I (PSST) labeling without effect on 36 kDa subunit of complex I (ND1) (Schuler and Casida, 2001). The interaction of rotenone with active (&#39;pulsed&#39;) and thermally de-activated (&#39;resting&#39;) membrane-bound Complex I as revealed by inhibition of NADH-ubiquinone- and ubiquinol-NAD+ reductase activities was studied. Ki = 1 x 10(-9) M, k(on) = 5 x 10(7) M-1 min-1 and k(off) = 0.02 min-1 (inhibitory effect of rotenone on NADH oxidation) and Ki = 2 x 10(-8) M (inhibition of reverse electron transfer) were determined for pulsed enzyme. The equilibrium between de-activated and active enzyme is reached (K approximately 100) after the slow strongly temperature-dependent de-activation process has completed. Rotenone partially prevents and reverses the enzyme de-activation. About two order of magnitude difference in affinity of rotenone to the active and de-activated forms of the enzyme was demonstrated (Grivennikova et al., 1997). Dose-dependent relative affinities of rotenone to the inhibitory site of CI is shown in Fig. 3B (for more detail Grivennikova et al., 1997).  Most of the studies suggest that hydrophobic inhibitors like rotenone or Piericidin A most likely disrupt the electron transfer between the terminal Fe-S cluster N2 and ubiquinone (Fig. 3A).  &nbsp;    &nbsp;  Fig. 3A. Rotenone structure and a schematic representation of its binding site (and other Rotenone-like compounds) to CI. IMS: inter-membrane space (based on Lummen, 1998)  &nbsp;    &nbsp;  Fig. 3B. Fig. 2. Relative affinities of rotenone to the inhibitory site(s) of Complex I. Panel (A): activated submitochondrial particles (SMP) (2.8 mg/ml, approx. 0.4 microM Complex I) were incubated in the standard reaction mixture for 20 min at 25oC and residual initial rate of NADH oxidation was measured. 100% correspond to the specific activity of 1.0 micromol/min per mg of protein. Panel (B): curve 1 (o), SMP (48 microg/ml, approx. 8 nM Complex I) were activated in the assay cuvette and pre-incubated with rotenone in the presence of gramicidin and 10 mM malonate for 20 min at 25oC and the residual NADH oxidase activity was then measured; black circle: the same as (o), except that pre-incubation with rotenone was made in the presence of 10 mM succinate (no gramicidin and malonate), 10 mM malonate and gramicidin were added simultaneously with 100 microM NADH to measure the residual activity. Curve 2, presents the reverse electron transfer activity and curve 3, de-activated SMP were preincubated with rotenone as described for curve 1(o) (for further details see Grivennikova et al., 1997). Panel (C): The same as Panel B, curve 3, except for enzyme concentration was 0.5 mg/ml and rotenone concentration range which was increased to show interaction of the inhibitor with de-activated enzyme. The activity was measured after 200-fold dilution into the assay mixture. All the continues lines corresponds to the theoretical titration curves for the reversible single site inhibition with Ki values of 1 nM, 20 nM and 80 nM for the curves 1, 2 and 3, respectively (for further details see Grivennikova et al., 1997).   2. MPTP affinity to complex I binding sites. MPTP is not directly binding to CI and it is therefore non-toxic to DA neurons. MPTP exerts its toxicity after it is metabolized by mono-amino-oxidase, type B (MAO B), in astrocytes to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+). This metabolite binds to CI, and is toxic. MPP+ is a good substrate for dopamine transporters (DAT), expressed selectively by DA neurons (Greenamyre et al (2001). Due to both a positive charge and an amphoteric character, MPP+ specifically accumulates in mitochondria, where despite a lower affinity to the binding site of complex I than rotenone, it reaches high enough intra-mitochondrial concentrations to inhibit CI activity (Ramsay et al., 1991). The binding affinity of MPP+ is low (mM range), and it can be totally reversed by washing out.&nbsp; Competitive binding experiments with rotenone and MPP+ suggest that the two compounds bind to the same site of the CI (Ramasay et al., 1991). Schuler and Casida (2001) reported that MPP+ inhibits PSST and elevates ND1 labelling subunits of the mitochondrial complex I.  3. General characteristics of other complex I inhibitors. There is a variety of CI inhibitors, both naturally occurring besides rotenone such as Piericidin A (from Streptomyces mobaraensis), acetogenins (from various Annonaceae species) as well as their derivatives, and synthetically manufactured compounds like pyridaben and various piperazin derivatives (Ichimaru et al. 2008). They have been used to probe the catalytic activity of complex I especially in order to clarify its ubiquinone binding site and indeed, most of these compounds inhibit the electron transfer step from the Fe-S clusters to ubiquinone (Friedrich et al. 1994). Therefore, classification of CI inhibitors is based on their types of action. Type A inhibitors, like piericidin A, 2-decyl-4-quinazolinyl amine (DQA), annonin VI and rolliniastatin-1 and -2, are considered to be antagonists of the ubiquinone substrate. For piericidin A, it has been shown that it inhibits NADH:Q2 activity in a partially competitive manner. Contrary to type A, type B inhibitors, like the commonly used rotenone, have hydrogen-bonding acceptors only in the cyclic head of the molecule and are non-competitive towards UQ (ubiquinone), but are believed to displace the semiquinone intermediate during the catalysis (Fig. 2). Finally, inhibitors classified as type C, like stigmatellin and capsaicin, form a third group of hydrophobic CI inhibitors that are believed to act as antagonists of reduced ubiquinone (Degli Esposti 1998, Friedrich et al. 1994, Haefeli 2012) (Fig. 2). Competition studies with representatives of all three different types of inhibitors revealed that type A and B and type B and C, but not type A and C, compete with each other for binding. This led to a suggestion that all CI inhibitors acting at the ubiquinone binding pocket share a common binding domain with partially overlapping sites (Okun et al. 1999).  Some inhibitors bind to the outside of the ubiquinone reduction site and do not fit the preceding classification. Examples of such compounds are ADP-ribose, which competes for substrate binding at the NADH site (Zharova and Vinogradov, 1997), and diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) that covalently binds to reduced flavin mononucleotide (FMN) in the hydrophilic part of the enzyme blocking the electron transfer to the Fe-S clusters (Majander et al., 1994). There are also new, commercially available insecticides/acaricides with potential to inhibit mitochondrial respiration such as benzimidazole, bullatacin, 6-chlorobenzothiadiazole, cyhalothrin, Fenazaquin Fenpyroximate, Hoe 110779, Pyridaben, Pyrimidifen, Sandoz 547A, Tebufenpyrad and Thiangazole (Greenamyre et al., 2001). It is clear that they are capable of inhibiting the mammalian CI of mitochondrial respiratory chain, by binding to and blocking ubiquinone-dependent NADH oxidation with high efficacy (Lummen, 1998)."@en ;

  dc:description "Neurotoxic effects shall be carefully addressed and reported in routine required regulatory toxicological studies (acute toxicity studies,short-term toxicity studies, long term toxicity and carcinogenicity studies and reproductive toxicity studies). Regarding neurotoxicity in rodents, inclusion of neurotoxicity investigations in routine toxicology studies shall also be considered. For pesticide active substances the circumstances in which neurotoxicity studies should be performed are listed in Regulation (EU) No 283/2013:  Specific neurotoxicity studies in rodents shall be performed in case of one those following conditions:   	there is indication of neurotoxicity in routine toxicity studies carried out with the active substance; 	the active substance is a structurally related to known neurotoxic compound; 	the active substance has a neurotoxic mode of pesticidal action.   As a result, specific neurotoxicity studies are not routinely required for all pesticide active substances. Specific neurotoxicity testing becomes obligatory only if neurotoxicity has been observed during histopathological evaluation or in case of structural analogy with a known neurotoxic compound. Motor activity should be measured once in short-term repeated dose toxicity studies (OECD 407, 408 and 422) and several times in specific neurotoxicity studies (OECD 424, OECD 426 and cohort 2 of OECD 443). However, this is not a requirement in chronic toxicity studies unless neurotoxic effects have been reported in the shorter studies. The same test (measures horizontal and/or vertical movements in a test chamber) is implemented in both routine studies and neurotoxicity studies. Coordination and balance are evaluated by rotation or rotarod or pole tests, and gait abnormalities by forepaw stride length test. Those tests are not required by any repeated dose toxicity OECD guidelines and they can be optionally incorporated in the design of neurotoxicity studies OECD 424 and OECD 426.  Although motor deficits is the AO in this AOP, degeneration of DA neurons, is also considered an adverse effect in the regulatory framework, even in the absence of clear clinical symptoms or motor deficits. Morphological assessment of brain structures is a standard requirement in the regulatory toxicological studies supporting the risk assessment of chemical substances and it is a regulatory expectation that the anatomical structures belonging to the nigrostriatal pathway would be included and evaluated as part of the standard evaluation of the brain. Treatment related neuronal degeneration, when occurring as a consequence of the treatment, is generally dose-dependent in incidence and severity. However, if not accompanied by clinical signs or behavioral changes indicative of central nervous system pathology, minimal loss of DA neurons would likely remain undetected in the standard histological evaluation, due to the presence of non DA neurons or as a consequence of the subjectivity of non-quantifiable analysis, unless specific markers are used. As multiple forms of perturbation can affect the neurons, some changes are potentially still reversible (e.g. loss of TH or DA) and irreversibility should be confirmed as part of the assessment. It is then important to apply a sensitive and appropriate method (Switzer 2000) and evaluation of the phenotypic markers in the striatum and in the SNpc should be always performed as a minimum standard (Minnema et al.,&nbsp;2014) when investigating perturbation of the nigrostriatal pathway. It should additionally consider that rat is likely to be a poor model to capture this kind of hazard, as demonstrated by the poor sensitivity of rat to MPTP or related compounds and this should be taken into account for the design and interpretation of the studies.  Dissimilarities of chemical induced animal models to human disease are also important and should be carefully weighted when considering the duration and schedule of the study/treatment. Differently from the human disease, with the MPTP animal model, the damage occurs rapidly, is hardly progressive, is little age-dependent and formation of Lewy bodies is sometime not occurring (Efremova et al., 2015). Therefore, for different animals models, the standard 90 days toxicity study could not match with the chronic and progressive characteristics of the human disease and compensatory changes influencing DA metabolism and turnover and protein catabolism can occur during the treatment period with an impact on the time of onset of the lesion (Ossowska et al., 2005)."@en ;

  dc:description "Several observations indicate the involvement of hyperhomocysteinemia in neurodegeneration. Hcy levels may play a role in neuronal death via stimulation of glutamate receptors. Homocysteine is an agonist for metabotropic glutamate receptors as well as for NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate, as a partial antagonist) and AMPA (amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate)/Kainate ionotropic glutamate receptors (Lazarewicz et al. 2003; Poddar and Paul 2009). Hcy further mediated subsequent Ca2+ efflux to biphasic activation of p38 &nbsp;mitogen-activated protein kinase&nbsp; (MAPK) (poddar and Paul 2013). Second possible mechanism of Hcy toxicity is free radical species production, and downregulation of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase and peroxidase (Moat et al. 2000; Liu et al. 2013) &nbsp;Hcy has also been reported to modulate the expression of pro-inflammatory molecules, C-reactive protein in vascular smooth muscle cells (Pang et al. 2014). Moreover, Hcy is able to inhibit neurogenesis in the hippocampus and subventricular zone of the murine adult brain (Wang et al. 2012; Rabaneda et al. 2008). &nbsp;&nbsp; Hyperhomocysteinemia accelerates the dopaminergic cell death, probably due to the fact that hyperhomocysteinemia could cause a severe reduction in dopamine turnover in the striatum (De Lau et al. 2005).

  dc:description "Established regulatory guideline studies for inhalation toxicity focus on evident clinical signs of systemic toxicity, including death, or organ-specific toxicity following acute and (sub)chronic exposure respectively. In toxicological and safety pharmacological studies with airborne test items targeting the airways or the lungs as a whole, lung function is a relevant endpoint for the characterization of potential adverse events (OECD, 2018a; Hoymann, 2012). Hence, the AO &ldquo;decreased lung function&rdquo; is relevant for regulatory decision-making in the context of (sub)chronic exposure (OECD, 2018b; OECD, 2018c).  Regulatory relevance of the AO &ldquo;decreased lung function&rdquo; is evident when looking at the increased risk of diseases in humans following inhalation exposure, and because of its links to other comorbidities and mortality.  To aid diagnosis and monitoring of fibrosis, current recommendations include both the recording of potential environmental and occupational exposures as well as an assessment of lung function (Baumgartner et al., 2000). The latter typically confirms decreased lung function as demonstrated by a loss of lung volume. As the disease progresses, dyspnea and lung function worsen, and the prognosis is directly linked to the decline in FVC (Meltzer and Noble, 2008).   Chronic exposure to cigarette smoke and other combustion-derived particles results in the development of COPD. COPD is diagnosed on the basis of spirometry results as laid out in the ATS/ERS Task Force documents on the standardization of lung function tests and their interpretation (Pellegrino et al., 2005; Culver et al., 2017, Graham et al., 2019). Rapid rates of decline in the lung function parameter FEV1 are linked to higher risk of exacerbations, increased hospitalization and early death (Wise et al., 2006; Celli, 2010). Reduced FEV1 also poses a risk for serious cardiovascular events and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease (Sin et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2015).  &nbsp;"@en ;

  dc:description "High aspect ratio nanoparticles are not completely engulfed by macrophages due to their long shape (&gt; 10&micro;m) [8, 10].    Some studies analysed the effect of the length of nanoparticles (NPs) on the capacity of macrophages to phagocytose them.  The study of Sweeney et al 2015 demonstrated that treatment of primary human alveolar macrophages by multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) similar in term of diameter, specific surface area and purity but differ by their length differentially alter phagocytosis [6]. Indeed, treatment by the longer CNT (median length 19.3 &micro;m) induced frustrated phagocytosis and receptor expression (MARCO) as well as decreased phagocytic ability and migratory capacity in a more extend manner than the shorter CNT (median length 1.1 &micro;m) [6]. Another study analysed the effect of particle morphology on the ability of human monocytic cell line THP-1 to engulf carbon nanotubes [9]. Cells were treated for 24h by two longs CNTs (men length 13 and 36 &micro;m, dimeter 84.89 and 165.02 nm), two tangled CNTs (length 1-5 and 5-20 &micro;m, dimeter 14.84 and 10.40 nm) and one short CNT (length 1-2 &micro;m, diameter 25.7 nm). The authors observed by light microscopy that only the two long CNTs are protruding from the cells. A study on THP-1 cells treated for 4h was conducted with silver nanowires that possess similar diameter but different length (average length: 3, 5, 10, 14 and 28 &micro;m) [8]. The authors observed by bright-field microscopy that the shorter NPs (3 and 5) were fully enclosed by macrophages, while the longer NPs (14 and 28) caused frustrated phagocytosis. In addition, injection of NPs in mouse pleural cavity followed by pleural lavage demonstrated that the shorter (3 and 5) were fully phagocytosed whereas the longer (10) caused frustrated phagocytosis. The authors observed differences between in vitro and in vivo studies in term of sensitivity for the determination of the length threshold that caused frustrated phagocytosis [8]. Finally, Padmore et al showed by time-lapse video microscopy that immortalized MH-S murine alveolar macrophages were able to internalized short glass fibres (mean length 7 &micro;m) whereas the longer fibres were not (mean length 39.3&nbsp;&micro;m) [7].    All together, these studies could suggest that the threshold for frustrated phagocytosis should be around 10 &micro;m, close to the suggestion formulated by Donaldson et al that fibres longer than 15 &micro;m cause this process [10]."@en ;

  dc:description "This AOP describes an adverse outcome that results from the Luteinizing hormone (LH) receptor antagonism leading to reproductive dysfunction in female fish. Luteinizing hormone (LH) is glycoprotein hormones, called gonadotropins, that control gonadal functions. Gonadotropins exert their action through gonadotropin receptors, the LH receptor. In many species, LHR is primarily expressed in reproductive organs and function coordinately to control steroidogenesis and ovulation. It is well known that in teleosts, LHR is expressed primarily in the theca and granulosa cells of preovulatory ovarian follicles. LH regulates the expression of a variety of genes essential for ovulation, such as genes that code for steroidogenic enzymes (CYP11A1) which convert from cholesterol to pregnelone resulting the synthesis of progesterone. It is well organized that the luteinizing hormone triggers ovulation through progesterone binding to the progesterone receptor. The nuclear progesterone receptor, which is a member of the nuclear receptor transcription factor superfamily, has been suggested as an essential factor for LH-dependent ovulation in fish. In conclusion, LHR inhibition leads to a reduction of the synthesis of Progesterone, which is indispensable for ovulation and fertility in fish.

  dc:description "The AHR can be activated by several structurally diverse chemicals, but binds preferentially to planar halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Dioxin-like compounds (DLCs), which include polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and certain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), are among the most potent AHR ligands[38]. Only a subset of PCDD, PCDF and PCB congeners has been shown to bind to the AHR and cause toxic effects to those elicited by TCDD. Until recently, TCDD was considered to be the most potent DLC in birds[39]; however, recent reports indicate that 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (PeCDF) is more potent than TCDD in some species of birds.[40][13][41][21][42][43] When screened for their ability to induce aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) activity, dioxins with chlorine atoms at a minimum of three out of the four lateral ring positions, and with at least one non-chlorinated ring position are the most active[44]. Of the dioxin-like PCBs, non-ortho congeners are the most toxicologically active, while mono-ortho PCBs are generally less potent[45][9]. Chlorine substitution at ortho positions increases the energetic costs of assuming the coplanar conformation required for binding to the AHR [45]. Thus, a smaller proportion of mono-ortho PCB molecules are able to bind to the AHR and elicit toxic effects, resulting in reduced potency of these congeners. Other PCB congeners, such as di-ortho substituted PCBs, are very weak AHR agonists and do not likely contribute to dioxin-like effects [9].   	Contrary to studies of birds and mammals, even the most potent mono-ortho PCBs bind to AhRs of fishes with very low affinity, if at all (Abnet et al 1999; Doering et al 2014; 2015; Eisner et al 2016; Van den Berg et al 1998).   The role of the AHR in mediating the toxic effects of planar hydrophobic contaminants has been well studied, however the endogenous role of the AHR is less clear [1]. Some endogenous and natural substances, including prostaglandin PGG2 and the tryptophan derivatives indole-3-carbinol, 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ) and kynurenic acid can bind to and activate the AHR. [6][46][47][48][49] The AHR is thought to have important endogenous roles in reproduction, liver and heart development, cardiovascular function, immune function and cell cycle regulation [50][38][51][52][53][54][46][55][56][57] and activation of the AHR by DLCs may therefore adversely affect these processes."@en ;

  dc:description "Psoriasis model mice have been developed as a tool for understanding the etiology of this disease and as a preclinical model. Five representative models are based on K14-amphiregulin, K5-Stat3C, K5-Tie2, K5-TGF-&beta;1, and imiquimod. There were statistically significant similarities between the gene expression patterns associated with epidermal development and keratinization in these models and the gene expression patterns in human psoriasis. Direct high-level activation of keratinocytes via autoclean growth factor (amphiregulin) has the ability to induce cytokine-related genetic circuits that closely resemble human psoriasis. Through transgenes, inward mutations (CARD14), injury, and exposure to specific T cell-producing cytokines, activated keratinocytes induce and lead to a chronic inflammatory response that is highly consistent with psoriasis. However, there were frequent differences in the expression of immune-related genes between the models. (Cook PW et al. 1997)  &nbsp;"@en ;

  dc:description "Psoriasis is an chronic autoimmune disease characterized &nbsp;by chronic epithelial inflammatory disease induced by environmental factors such as infection, stress, smoking or alcohol consumption as well as by genetic factors. The onset of psoriasis has been reported to be triggered by drugs and chemical substances use, including &nbsp;beta-blockers, chloroquine, lithium, ACE inhibitors, indomethacin, terbinafine, and interferon alpha. Diagnosis is based on the type and distribution of the lesions.  Psoriasis occurs when abnormal differentiation (keratosis) of keratinocytes leads to thickening of the epidermis. Patients often exhibit an erythema with a clear border and epidermal hyperplasia, stratum corneum hyperplasia, heterocytosis in the stratum corneum, mixed skin moist cells of neutrophilic granulocytes and T cells in the epidermis. Dendritic cells (DC) and macrophages are associated with silver-white plaque. Neutrophilic effusion (Munro microabscesses) are observed in the epidermis, and CD8+ T cells (Tc17) increase the expression of angiogenesis related genes.  The main therapeutic agents are mild topical treatments such as emollients, salicylic acid, coal tar preparations, anthralin, corticosteroids, vitamin D3 derivatives, retinoids, calcineurin inhibitors or tazarotene. UV therapy is also used for moderate or severe psoriasis. Widespread psoriasis is treated with systemic therapies such as immunomodulators methotrexate, cyclosporin, retinoids and other immunosuppressants used alone or in combination.  Although there are stressors that are well known to induce psoriasis-like skin inflammation in mice, this AOP is based primarily on an understanding of stimulation caused by imiquimod, resiquimod or LL37-selfRNA complexes, for which a significant body of scientific literature has been published.  As a test model for psoriasis, an Autoimmune skin disease, mouse tests that induce skin inflammation like psoriasis are frequently conducted using the imidazoquinoline derivative imiquimod. This AOP is primarily based on an understanding of stimuli caused by imiquimod, resiquimod, or LL37-selfRNA complexes.  Imiquimod is derived from imidazoquinoline and is often used to create mouse models. It is our hope that this AOP will contribute to greater knowledge about the development of psoriatic skin diseases that start from stimulation of TLR as well as the development of new treatment targets for psoriasis."@en ;

  dc:description "It is well recognized that allergic diseases and autoimmune diseases are markedly increased the last several decades.&nbsp; About the same time, increasing scientific and social attention had been paid to environmentally dispersed chemicals that can enter the body by ingestion or adsorption and that mimic the actions of estrogens.&nbsp; These chemicals are termed endocrine disruptors (EDs) or environmental estrogens and are found in plastics (bisphenol-A, phthalates), pesticides (DDT, hexachlorobenzene, and dieldrin) and the like.&nbsp; Some of these estrogenic chemicals have also been shown to influence the immune system.&nbsp; Endocrine disruptors mimic hormones, block or alter hormone binding to receptors, or alter the metabolism of natural estrogens.&nbsp; It has been widely noted that females have stronger immune capabilities than males, as evidenced by their better immune responses to a variety of self-antigens and non-self-antigens, or vaccination.&nbsp; Paradoxically, the stronger immune response comes at a steep price, which is the high incidence of autoimmune diseases in females.&nbsp; This phenomenon of gender-based immune capability is largely attributed to the effects of sex hormones.&nbsp; Estrogens regulate the level of serum and uterine IgM, IgA, and IgG, and they augment antibody production to several nonself- antigens and self-antigens. It is possible that endocrine disruptors that mimic estrogenic activity may be involved in the increased incidence of autoimmune diseases such as SLE (Yurino H. 2004, Vaishali RM. 2018)."@en ;

BPA binds to both ER&alpha; and ER&beta;, and ER&alpha; binding affinity of BPA is lower than that of ER&beta; (Takayanagi S. 2006).&nbsp; While these bindings are less than 2000‑fold affinity compared to the binding of estradiol to estrogen receptors (Krishnan AV. 1993).

These findings question the safety of TI-containing plant foods, and many different studies and reviews have been published to date. The important factors for TI-induced pancreatic acinar cell tumors seem to be a high level of CCK release and CCK-stimulated acinar cell proliferation.

  dc:description "Receptor recognition is an essential determinant of molecular level in this AOP. ACE2 was reported as an entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. The viral entry process is mediated by the envelope-embedded surface-located spike (S) glycoprotein.&nbsp; Jun Lan and Walls, A.C et al (Nature 581, 215&ndash;220; Cell 180, 281&ndash;292) demonstrated a critical initial step of infection at the molecular level from the interaction of ACE2 and S protein. ACE2 has shown that receptor binding affinity to S protein is nM range. To elucidate the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 at a higher resolution, they also determined the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD&ndash;ACE2 complex using X-ray crystallography. The expression and distribution of the ACE2 in human body may indicate the potential infection of SARS-CoV-2. Through the developed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) technique and single-cell transcriptomes based on the public database, researchers analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile at single-cell resolution. High ACE2 expression was identified in type II alveolar cells (Zou, X. et al. Front.

  dc:description "Alkylating agents are prototypical DNA-reactive compounds and have been extensively studied for decades (reviewed in Beranek 1990). The chemicals can be direct-acting electrophiles, or can be converted from non-reactive substances to reactive metabolites via metabolism. A prototypical alkylating agent is N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (chemical formula C3H7N3O2) (ENU). ENU is rapidly absorbed following oral exposure and intraperitoneal injections and distributed widely across the tissues. ENU is unstable and readily reacts with somatic and germ cell DNA in mice, rats, flies and hamsters, to alkylate DNA. Very generally, mono-functional (referring to the transfer of a single alkyl group) alkylating agents include: 1.	Alkyl sulfates: e.g., diethyl (DES) and dimethyl sulfate (DMS);  2.	Alkyl alkanesulfonates: e.g., methyl (MMS) and ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS);  3.	Nitrosamides: e.g., methyl (MNU) and ethyl nitrosourea (ENU), methyl- (MNNG) and ethyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (ENNG), and the indirect-acting (i.e., requiring metabolic activation) dimethyl (DMN) and diethyl nitrosamines (DEN).  ENU is the most widely studied and understood alkylating agent and as such has been instrumental in contributing to the knowledgebase in this field. Immunohistochemistry studies clearly indicate the presence of alkylated DNA following exposure to ENU in both somatic cells and spermatogonia (Kamino et al. 1995; Seiler et al. 1997; van Zeeland et al. 1990)."@en ;

  dc:description "1.1 Binding and activation of receptor  PPAR&gamma; ligands thiazolidinediones (Rosiglitazone, Pioglitazone, Troglitazone) (Lehmann et al. 1995), (Forman et al. 1995), (Willson et al. 2000).  Phthalates  MEHP (CAS 4376-20-9) directly binds to PPAR&gamma; (Lapinskas et al. 2005), (ToxCastTM Data)in vitro and in silico (Feige et al. 2007), (Rotman et al. 2008), (Kaya et al. 2006) and activates this receptor in transactivation assays (Maloney &amp; Waxman 1999), (Hurst &amp; Waxman 2003b), (Venkata et al. 2006), (ToxCastTM Data). In summary, there is experimental in vitro evidence for binding and transcriptional activation of PPAR&gamma;. DEHP (CAS 117-81-7) was not found to bind and activate PPAR&gamma; (Lapinskas et al. 2005), (Maloney &amp; Waxman 1999). However recent studies show activation of PPAR&gamma; by DEHP(ToxCastTM Data), (Pereira-Fernandes et al. 2013). DEHP was also found to increase the levels of PPAR&gamma; in vitro (Lin et al. 2011). Notably, PPAR&gamma; is responsive to DEHP in vitro and is translocated to the nucleus (in primary Sertoli cells) (Dufour et al. 2003), (Bhattacharya et al. 2005).  Parabens  Butylparaben was not found to bind to the PPAR&gamma; (ToxCastTM Data), but activated the human PPAR&gamma; (ToxCastTM Data), (Pereira-Fernandes et al. 2013) and mPPAR&gamma; in reporter gene assay (Taxvig et al., 2012).  Phenols  Bisphenol A was not found to bind to the PPAR&gamma; (ToxCastTM Data), but activated the human PPAR&gamma; (ToxCastTM Data), (Pereira-Fernandes et al. 2013) but not mouse PPAR&gamma; (Taxvig et al., 2012) in reporter gene assay. BPA was also reported to increase PPAR&gamma; (mRNA) in ovarian granulosa cell line and human luteinized granulosa cells (Kwintkiewicz, Nishi, Yanase, &amp; Giudice, 2010).  Organotin  Tributyltin (TBT) activates all three heterodimers of PPAR with RXR, primarily through its interaction with RXR (le Maire et al. 2009).   1.2 Activation of target genes  MEHP activation of endogenous PPAR&gamma; target genes was evidenced by the stimulation of PPAR&gamma;-dependent adipogenesis in the 3T3-L1 cell differentiation model (Hurst &amp; Waxman, 2003)."@en ;

Standard information requirements include a screening study on reproduction toxicity (OECD TG 421/422) at Annex VIII (10-100 t.p.a), a prenatal developmental toxicity study (OECD 414) on a first species at Annex IX (100-1000 t.p.a), and from March 2015 the OECD 443(Extended One-Generation Reproductive Toxicity Study) is reproductive toxicity requirement instead of the two generation reproductive toxicity study (OECD TG 416). If not conducted already at Annex IX, a prenatal developmental toxicity study on a second species at Annex X (&ge; 1000 t.p.a.).  Under the Biocidal Products Regulation (BPR), information is also required on reproductive toxicity for active substances as part of core data set and additional data set (EU 2012, ECHA 2013). As a core data set, prenatal developmental toxicity study (EU TM B.31) in rabbits as a first species and a two-generation reproduction toxicity study (EU TM B.31) are required. OECD TG 443 (Extended One-Generation Reproductive Toxicity Study) shall be considered as an alternative approach to the multi-generation study.)

  dc:description "A large number of drugs and chemicals have been shown to antagonise the AR using various AR reporter gene assays. The AR is specifically targeted in AR-sensitive cancers, for example the use of the anti-androgenic drug flutamide in treating prostate cancer (Alapi &amp; Fischer, 2006). Flutamide has also been used in several rodent in vivo studies showing anti-androgenic effects (feminization of male offspring) evident by e.g. short anogenital distance (AGD) in males (Foster &amp; Harris, 2005; Hass et al, 2007; Kita et al, 2016). QSAR models can predict AR antagonism for a wide range of chemicals, many of which have shown in vitro antagonistic potential (Vinggaard et al, 2008)."@en ;

  dc:description "Characterization of chemical properties: Chemicals are known to inhibit aromatase activity through two primary molecular mechanisms. Steroid-like structures can inhibit the enzyme at its active site, with structures having ∆4 positioned double bonds generally acting as stronger inhibitors than those with ∆5 positioned double bonds (Petkov et al. 2009). Non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors generally act by interfering with electron transfer via the cytochrome P450 heme group of the aromatase enzyme, with greater nucleophilicity of the heteroatom contributing to greater potency as an inhibitor (Petkov et al. 2009). Petkov et al. (Petkov et al. 2009) have provided a detailed analysis of structural categorization of chemicals as potential steroidal or non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors."@en ;

  dc:description "In fish&nbsp;sexual differentiation occurs post hatch and can be influenced&nbsp;by exogenous factors such as chemicals, temperature, pH, population density, social cues and more. As a result, the gonadal sex phenotype in oviparous fish&nbsp;can be altered by environmental conditions experienced during development, particularly in conjunction with sexual differentiation (Scholz and Kl&uuml;ver, 2009). At this stage, the bipotential gonad can differentiate&nbsp;to either testes or ovaries&nbsp;depending both on genetic and environmental factors (Str&uuml;ssmann and Nakamura, 2002). Sex steroids are among the factors that influence sex differentiation in non-mammalian vertebrates; in many fish species exogenous androgens and estrogens act, respectively, to enhance the development of testes and ovaries in exposed animals (Nakamura 2010). In teleost fish, the relative balance between endogenous estrogens and androgens during sexual differentiation is critical to ensuring normal sex ratios and, ultimately, viable populations.&nbsp;Various homeostatic mechanisms ensure that steroid biosynthesis is appropriately controlled during development. A key biosynthetic enzyme is CYP19a1 (aromatase), which is responsible for the conversion of C19 androgens (e.g., T) to C18 estrogens (e.g., E2) in brain and gonadal tissues of vertebrates (Payne and Hales, 2004; Simpson et al. 1994).&nbsp; In fish, there are two CYP19a1 isoforms, with CYP19a1a mostly expressed in the gonads and CYP19a1b largely expressed in the brain (Callard et al. 2001).  Since the mid-90s, there has been concern about the potential impacts of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in fish and wildlife. Many &nbsp;EDCs can exert effects in early life stages that can lead to potential impacts at the population level. For example, some chemicals have been shown to alter the sexual phenotype of fish by affecting steroidogenic enzymes such as aromatase. Inhibition&nbsp;of CYP19a1 expression or activity can alter the production &nbsp;of estrogens in &nbsp;developing gonads, affecting processes such as gonadal differentiation. In many fish species the &ldquo;default&rdquo; gonad type is testes, so when estrogen signaling is reduced there is&nbsp;a resultant bias toward male-biased sex ratios (Guiguen et al. 2010). &nbsp;&nbsp;When male biased sex ratios occur, the number of breeding females can decrease over time and have negative impacts on population growth and sustainability. The present AOP provides the evidence framework of the negative impacts of aromatase inhibition at early developmental stages of teleost fish &nbsp;during the critical period of sexual differentiation and how this could&nbsp;lead to &nbsp;population-level effects.   &nbsp;  &nbsp;"@en ;

Stress conditions or inhibition of 11bHSD dehydrogenase activities result in a cortisol excess in the Leydig cells. A surplus of glucocorticoids causes delayed genomic repression of 11KT&nbsp;production through GR or a rapid nongenomic decrease in 11 KT&nbsp;production. The rapid depression has been hypothesized to occur via the putative plasma membrane corticosteroid receptor11&beta;HSD2 is unidirectional with NAD+ as a cofactor. It is expressed not only in mineralocorticoid sensitive tissues such as testis.11&beta;HSD has enzyme activities, metabolizing cortisol to cortisone, and 11 beta -hydroxytestosterone to 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) which is the main androgen functions spermatogenesis.

Cortisol has also been cross talked to be involved in reproduction and sex differentiation at a proper level for the success of spawning, oocyte maturation, and the survival of progeny in teleosts. In females, the 11&beta;-hydroxylase knockout females showed less spawned eggs and the eggs were defective in germinal vesicle breakdown. Stress conditions or inhibition of 11&beta;-hydroxylase activities finally decreased 11KT and cortisol in the Leydig and Sertoli cells. Taken together, the inhibitors of 11&beta;-hydroxylase (i.e metyrapone, lysodren, eomidate and ketoconazole etc.) could result in decreased 11-KT and cortisol, subsequently, leading to impairment of spermatogenesis and oocyte maturation and ovulation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  			Acknowledgements:&nbsp;This research was supported by the National Research Council of Science &amp; Technology(NST) grant by the Korea&nbsp;government (MSIP) (No. CAP-17-01-KIST Europe)&nbsp;&nbsp;"@en ;

  dc:description "Arthropods (including insects, crustaceans and arachnids) need to shed their exoskeleton in order to grow and reproduce. This process, also called molting or ecdysis, is mediated by behavioural mechanisms which involve the skeletal muscles (Ayali 2009; Song et al. 2017a). In order to properly shed its cuticle, the organism needs to possess a newly synthesized cuticle that possesses a certain integrity to support this process. Since chitin is a major constituent of the cuticle, it contributes substantially to its integrity (Cohen 2001; Vincent and Wegst 2004). Chitin is synthesized from uridine diphosphate-N-Acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) in a polymerization reaction by the transmembrane enzyme chitin synthase isoform 1 (CHS-1). CHS-1 is localized on the apical side in the cuticular epithelium. Since chitin and the process of chitin synthesis does not occur in vertebrates, it can and has been exploited for the design of pest controlling agents. Inhibitors of chitin synthesis may not only be of use for the control of unwanted arthropods and fungi, they may also pose a risk for beneficial arthropods such as insects and crustaceans. Disruption of chitin synthesis or the endocrine mechanisms controlling molting generally lead to a disruption of ecdysis (Merzendorfer et al. 2012; Song et al. 2017a; Song et al. 2017b). If the amount of chitin in the cuticle decreases, the affected organism may not be able to molt properly and will most probably die of starvation or suffocation (Camp et al. 2014; Song et al. 2017a). Alternatively, if molting is completed despite an immature cuticle, the organism may be deformed and die as a consequence of a weak cuticle. Therefore, the present AOP should build the basis of a mechanistic approach for the systematic evaluation and the risk assessment of chemicals interfering with chitin synthesis by directly inhibiting CHS-1."@en ;

The initial search terms were: &quot;(zebra-)fish&quot;, &quot;eye development&quot;, &quot;retina&quot;, &quot;thyroid/hormone disorders&quot;, &quot;visual behavio(u)r&quot;, &quot;photoreceptors&quot; and combinations of these terms. A very detailed manual search followed for the various KEs and KERs. Not only articles on chemical exposure of different animals were considered, but also more basic studies using other THSD induction techniques such as transgenic or mutant fish, microinjection, morpholino oligonucleotides, thyroidectomy, etc. The range of data that was assessed is wide, from gene expression and hormone levels to physiological and behavioural changes in different animals. In total, around 120 articles from this&nbsp;structured search&nbsp;were analysed in terms of experimental design and information on different biological levels. The majority of literature used fish, especially zebrafish (85%), which is why this AOP focuses on fish, but it can probably be applied to other vertebrate species as well."@en ;

Brouwer and van den Berg (1986) reported preferential binding of a metabolite of radiolabeled tetrachlorobiphenyl to TTR in rats (15 mg/kg, ip), using gel electrophoresis followed by HPLC analysis. Van den Berg (1990) used a competitive binding assay to assess the ability of hydroxylated chlorinated aromatic compounds to bind to radiolabeled T4. Van den Berg et al (1991) extended this work to 65 compounds from 12 different chemical groups in rats treated via a single ip dose and competitive binding assay. Chlorophenols were found to have higher affinity relative to other chlorinated aromatics, particular at higher levels of chlorination, and the combination and position of hydroxyl &amp; chlorine atoms. {insert Figure 2/Van den Berg 1990}  Lans et al (1993) described the ability of hydroxylated metabolites of PCBs, PCDDs and PCDFs to act as competetive ligands at the TTR-T4 binding site using an in vitro binding assay. Many of the hydroxylated PCBs examined were more potent ligands than T4, as opposed to those PCDFs and PCDDs that lacked chlorine atoms substituted adjacent to hydroxyl groups. When the hydroxyl group was in the meta or para positions, a 35- to 136-fold greater potency was found relative to ortho substitutions. These results were confirmed through later competitive binding work published by Cheek et al (1999) and Chauhan et al (2000).  Weiss et al (2009) first confirmed competitive binding of TTR with perfluorinated compounds (PFCs)"@en ;

  dc:description "During the 1970s, an increased incidence of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas was observed in rodents treated with a variety of seemingly disparate chemicals. The common effect was an increase in&nbsp;the number and size of peroxisomes and these substances were labeled&nbsp;&lsquo;&lsquo;peroxisome proliferators&rsquo;&rsquo; (Rao &amp; Reddy, 1996). Peroxisomes are subcellular organelles involved in&nbsp;long chain fatty acid catabolism through the &beta;-oxidation cycle (de Duve, 1996). Peroxisomes&nbsp;increase in number and/or size following exposure to substances that perturb fatty acid homeostasis. These substances include marketed pharmaceutical agents and drug candidates,&nbsp;phthalate ester plasticizers or their metabolites,&nbsp;herbicides , solvents&nbsp; and perfluorinated chemicals (Klaunig et al., 2003).&nbsp;Hepatocellular hypertrophy and hyperplasia, changes in apoptosis rates, Kupffer cell activation, and oxidative stress were also observed following chronic exposure of rats and mice&nbsp;to peroxisome proliferators (Corton, 2010).   The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &alpha; (PPAR&alpha;) was identified after cloning&nbsp;from mouse DNA (Issemann &amp; Green, 1990). PPAR&alpha; along with the PPARb/d and PPARg subtypes are ligand-activated transcription factors with both&nbsp;DNA-binding and ligand-binding domain with&nbsp;variation in&nbsp;tissue distribution, expression during&nbsp;development, ligand specificity, and biological function. PPAR&alpha; is expressed in metabolically active tissues, including the liver, kidney, brown fat and heart, which exhibit pleiotropic responses to peroxisome proliferators. The biological functions and role in chemical effects of PPAR&alpha; has been facilitated by the PPAR&alpha;-null mouse&nbsp; the experimental use of which revealed that a&nbsp;functional PPAR&alpha; was required for the obseved phenotypic effects&nbsp;and led to the identification of the genes involved in lipid catabolism, lipid transport,&nbsp;peroxisome proliferation and hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas (Corton, 2010; Lee et al., 1995).&nbsp;&nbsp;  Like other nuclear receptors,&nbsp;PPAR&alpha; forms a heterodimer before translocating to the nucleus.&nbsp;&nbsp;with another nuclear receptor family member, retinoid X receptor (RXR), the receptor for 9-cis-retinoic acid. The PPAR&alpha;-RXR heterodimer binds to peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs)&nbsp;usually found in the promoter or enhancer regions. The PPRE consensus sequence consists of the sequence 5&rsquo;-AACT AGGTCA A AGGTCA-3&rsquo;&nbsp;with PPAR&alpha; occupying the 5&rsquo; position. After agonist binding to PPAR&alpha;, co-repressors dissociate from the complex leading to de-acetylation, chromatin remodeling&nbsp; to enable transcription&nbsp;(Escher &amp; Wahli, 2000; G&ouml;ttlicher et al., 1992; Moreno et al. 2010).&nbsp;"@en ;

  dc:description "Receptor recognition is an essential determinant of molecular level in this AOP. ACE2 was reported as an entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. The viral entry process is mediated by the envelope-embedded surface-located spike (S) glycoprotein.&nbsp; Jun Lan and Walls, A.C et al (Nature 581, 215&ndash;220; Cell 180, 281&ndash;292) demonstrated a critical initial step of infection at the molecular level from the interaction of ACE2 and S protein. ACE2 has shown that receptor binding affinity to S protein is nM range. To elucidate the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 at a higher resolution, they also determined the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD&ndash;ACE2 complex using X-ray crystallography. The expression and distribution of the ACE2 in human body may indicate the potential infection of SARS-CoV-2. Through the developed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) technique and single-cell transcriptomes based on the public database, researchers analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile at single-cell resolution.

  dc:description "Characterization of chemical properties: Androgen receptor binding chemicals can be grouped into two broad structural domains, steroidal and non-steroidal (Yin et al. 2003). Steroidal androgens consist primarily of testosterone and its derivatives (Yin et al. 2003). Many of the non-steroidal AR binding chemicals studied are derivatives of well known non-steroidal AR antagonists like bicalutamide, hydroxyflutamide, and nilutamide (Yin et al. 2003). Nonetheless, a number of QSARs and SARs that consider AR binding of both these pharmaceutical agents as well as environmental chemicals have been developed (Waller et al. 1996; Serafimova et al. 2002; Todorov et al. 2011; Hong et al. 2003; Bohl et al. 2004). However, it has been shown that very minor structural differences can dramatically impact function as either an agonist or antagonist (Yin et al. 2003; Bohl et al. 2004; Norris et al. 2009), making it difficult at present to predict agonist versus antagonist activity based on chemical structure alone.  In vivo considerations: A variety of steroidal androgens can be converted to estrogens in vitro through the action of cytochrome P450 19 (aromatase). Structures subject to aromatization may behave in vivo as estrogens despite exhibiting potent androgen receptor agonism in vitro."@en ;

[27] Interestingly, some chemicals significantly alkylate proteins without causing toxicity, which suggests that only alkylation of a specific protein subset critical subset contributes to injury. Indeed, Codreanu presented an inventory of proteins affected by electrophile-mediated alkylation in intact cells and suggested that non-toxic covalent binding largely affects cytoskeletal protein components, whereas toxic covalent binding induces lethal injury by targeting factors involved in protein synthesis and catabolism and possibly mitochondrial electron transport. [3] In vitro covalent binding studies to macromolecules have been used to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms of chemical-induced toxicity. Experimental work with kidney epithelial cells by Chen et al suggested that following alkylation of cellular macromolecules as initial cytotoxic event both sulfhydryl depletion and lipid peroxidation are components of the cytotoxic mechanism [28]  Dennehy et al have analyzed the protein targets in nuclear and cytoplasmic proteomes from human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) treated in vitro with two biotin-tagged, thiol-reactive electrophiles and mapped the adducts. Certain protein families appeared particularly susceptible to alkylation. [29]  Shin et al have identified protein targets of two biotin-tagged model electrophiles in human liver microsomes through LC-MS-MS and showed that different target selectivities of the two electrophile probes correlated with different biological outcomes and that alkylation reactions of specific targets could be quantified.

  dc:description "Sensitization of the respiratory tract by chemicals is the first stage in the development of chemical respiratory allergy, an immune-mediated hypersensitivity reaction to an exogenous low-molecular-weight chemical, which can result in asthma and rhinitis on repeated exposure and is an important occupational health problem. (Mapp et al., 2005) Due to the severity and irreversibility of the adverse effect, identifying chemical respiratory allergens is of considerable regulatory, industrial, and socioeconomic importance. (Boverhof et al., 2008) Efforts to outline a framework for assessment of potential respiratory-sensitizing chemicals are underway. (North et al., 2016) Currently, however, there are no standardized, validated, and regulatory-accepted models for detecting these chemicals or discriminating them from skin sensitizers, potentially due to remaining gaps within the literature as to the exact mechanistic steps leading to respiratory allergy. (Kimber et al., 2011)  Another important issue in the development of predictive test methods is the route of exposure in the sensitization phase. Inhalation exposure is perhaps the most common exposure route of concern for many substances, but there is evidence that sensitization of the respiratory tract can be induced via skin exposure as well. (Tarlo and Malo, 2006, Heederik et al., 2012, Redlich and Herrick, 2008, Kimber and Dearman, 2002) This knowledge has implications for both the mechanistic understanding of the pathway and the potential test methods that may be used to detect respiratory sensitizers. Therefore, this AOP will include information from models using skin and lung exposure (in vivo) and with dermal and respiratory cells and tissues (in vitro/ex vivo).  The outlines of this pathway follow the already-published skin sensitization AOP 40. However, the divergent AOs of the two pathways reflect differences in the effector response (T helper 1 [Th1] vs. T helper 2 [Th2]) and other mechanistic details of at least some KEs;(Kimber et al., 2014) these differences are the focus of this effort. Therefore, the primary evidence relied on to build this AOP must relate directly to known low-molecular-weight organic chemicals to the exclusion of chemicals that act via other mechanisms and therefore require a separate AOP, for example, chloroplatinates.  In brief, the AOP can be summarized as beginning with covalent protein binding, potentially preferentially to lysine nucleophiles in the lung or skin after respiratory or dermal exposure to a low-molecular-weight organic chemical. This protein binding causes the activation of stress response pathways and cellular danger signals, including oxidative stress, cytokines, and chemokines released by epithelial and other cells, leading to dendritic cell (DC) maturation and migration to the draining lymph nodes (DLN). Haptens can also contribute to DC activation directly. Th2-skewed DCs in the DLN signal activation and maturation of T cells, which characterize the sensitization phase, resulting in chemical respiratory allergy. Consistent with regulatory practice, sensitization is considered the AO. (Vandebriel et al., 2011)"@en ;

  dc:description "The in chemico, in vitro, and in vivo experimental evidence is logical and consistent with the mechanistic plausibility proposed by covalent reactions based on the protein binding theory ([1];[19];[20]). In selected cases, (e.g. 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene) where the same compound has been examined in a variety of assays (see Annex 1 of[21]), the coherence and consistency of the experimental data is excellent. Alternative mechanism that logically present themselves and the extent to which they may distract from the postulated AOP. It should be noted that alternative mechanisms of action, if supported, require a separate AOP. While covalent reactions with thiol groups and to lesser extent amino groups, are clearly supported by the proposed AOP, reactions targeting other nucleophiles may or may not be supported by the proposed AOP. Limited data on chemical reactivity shows that two competing reactions are possible, the faster reaction dominates. However, this has yet to be proven in vitro or in vivo.  Earlier work on the molecular basis of skin sensitisation was reviewed by Lepoittevin et al. (1998)[22], since then our knowledge of skin sensitisation has continued to expand. Recent reviews (see[3];[9];[20];[22];[23];[24];[25]) repeatedly stress the same key steps leading to sensitisation. These events include hapten formation (i.e., the ability of a chemical to react with skin proteins).  The binding behavior of diisocyanates in particular has been well studied. Wisnewski et al.29,30 demonstrate that hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and 4,4&rsquo;-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) react with glutathione (GSH) across an in vitro physiologically relevant vapor/liquid-phase barrier to form conjugates, which may &lsquo;&lsquo;shuttle,&rsquo;&rsquo; via a carbamoylating reaction, the chemical to bind with serum albumin. Diisocyanates (MDI) react with GSH across an in vitro physiologically relevant vapor/liquid-phase barrier to form conjugates, which may &lsquo;&lsquo;shuttle,&rsquo;&rsquo; via a carbamoylating reaction, the chemical to bind with serum albumin.  In contrast to skin sensitization where cysteine and lysine are both key nucleophiles, experimental work has suggested that some respiratory sensitizers appear to preferentially bind to lysine; (Hettick et al., 2012, Lalko et al., 2012, Holsapple et al., 2006, Hopkins et al., 2005) however, an in chemico analysis of a larger set of respiratory sensitizers indicates lack of a simple division between the reactivity preferences of the two types of sensitizers, showing that certain classes displayed a lysine preference, for example, anhydrides, whereas others, such as diisocyanates, do not. (Dik et al., 2016)  While respiratory sensitizers and skin sensitizers can both bind to cellular and serum proteins in separate cultures, a study comparing the binding profiles of both classes in co-culture systems found that skin sensitizers preferentially bind cellular proteins, while respiratory sensitizers preferentially bind serum proteins.

Hypo-fibrinolysis represents the first event (KE1866), in which interaction with SARS-COV-2 or nanomaterials causes decreased fibrinolytic response. The activation of the bradykinin system(KE1867) (MIE2), also instigated by SARS-COV-2 or nanomaterial stressors, can overactivate the bradykinin system and increases bradykinin production. As a result of hypo-fibrinolysis (KE1866), and bradykinin activation (KE1867), there is an increase in pro-inflammatory mediators secretion (KE1496), which signals the recruitment of pro-inflammatory cells into the lungs (KE1497). This KE process represents the changes occurring in inflammation. The increase in pro-inflammatory cells levels lead to a higher neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, increased CRP, and high D-dimer and ferritin levels, all hallmarks of a hyperinflammatory state (KE1868). Hyperinflammation plays a critical role in driving the severity of the COVID-19 disease. Further exploration of the inflammation to hyperinflammation process is needed."@en ;

  dc:description "In mammals, the primordial germ cells are initially &lsquo;bipotential&rsquo;. They will develop into either oocytes or gonocytes in ovaries or testis, respectively, depending on cues from the somatic environment. Germ cells in the developing testis will enter a quiescent state and reactivate at the onset of puberty. In contrast, germ cells in the developing ovary will enter meiosis (prophase I) during fetal life. A key signaling event for this sexual dimorphic germ cell programming is retinoid signaling, with all-trans retinoic acid (atRA) acting as a meiosis-inducing factor (Spiller &amp; Bowles, 2019).   The source of atRA during ovary development differs to some degree between species. In mice, the adjacent mesonephros, which expresses two enzymes necessary for the final step in atRA production, ALDH1A2 and ALDH1A3, is likely the main source of atRA at early developmental stages (Bowles et al, 2018; Bowles et al, 2006; Koubova et al, 2006; Niederreither et al, 1999). There is also the capacity for atRA to be produced within the ovary itself, due to local expression of the atRA-synthesizing enzyme ALDH1A1 (Bowles et al, 2016; Mu et al, 2013).   In humans, ALDH1A enzymes (ALDH1A, -1B and -1C) are expressed in both testes and ovaries of the developing fetus, which suggest a capacity for de novo synthesis of atRA (Childs et al, 2011; J&oslash;rgensen &amp; Rajpert-De Meyts, 2014; le Bouffant et al, 2010), as is also the case in rabbits (D&iacute;az-Hern&aacute;ndez et al, 2019). One team studying human fetal ovaries reported a peak of ALDH1A1 expression at the onset of meiosis (le Bouffant et al, 2010), suggesting that meiotic onset in the human ovary depends on provision of atRA at the correct time.&nbsp; There seems to be conservation from rodent to human in terms of the requirement for atRA to induce the pre-meiotic factor STRA8. However, in mice atRA is produced by adjacent tissue and is present at high concentrations in the ovaries, whereas in human ovaries RA is present at only low levels and is then actively produced to induce meiosis in the ovary (Spiller &amp; Bowles, 2019)."@en ;

  dc:source <https://h2020-sbd4nano.github.io/sbd-data-aopwiki/models/> ;
  dc:description "The in chemico, in vitro, and in vivo experimental evidence is logical and consistent with the mechanistic plausibility proposed by covalent reactions based on the protein binding theory ([1];[19];[20]). In selected cases, (e.g. 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene) where the same compound has been examined in a variety of assays (see Annex 1 of[21]), the coherence and consistency of the experimental data is excellent. Alternative mechanism that logically present themselves and the extent to which they may distract from the postulated AOP. It should be noted that alternative mechanisms of action, if supported, require a separate AOP. While covalent reactions with thiol groups and to lesser extent amino groups, are clearly supported by the proposed AOP, reactions targeting other nucleophiles may or may not be supported by the proposed AOP. Limited data on chemical reactivity shows that two competing reactions are possible, the faster reaction dominates. However, this has yet to be proven in vitro or in vivo.  Earlier work on the molecular basis of skin sensitisation was reviewed by Lepoittevin et al. (1998)[22], since then our knowledge of skin sensitisation has continued to expand. Recent reviews (see[3];[9];[20];[22];[23];[24];[25]) repeatedly stress the same key steps leading to sensitisation. These events include hapten formation (i.e., the ability of a chemical to react with skin proteins).  The binding behavior of diisocyanates in particular has been well studied. Wisnewski et al.29,30 demonstrate that hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and 4,4&rsquo;-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) react with glutathione (GSH) across an in vitro physiologically relevant vapor/liquid-phase barrier to form conjugates, which may &lsquo;&lsquo;shuttle,&rsquo;&rsquo; via a carbamoylating reaction, the chemical to bind with serum albumin. Diisocyanates (MDI) react with GSH across an in vitro physiologically relevant vapor/liquid-phase barrier to form conjugates, which may &lsquo;&lsquo;shuttle,&rsquo;&rsquo; via a carbamoylating reaction, the chemical to bind with serum albumin.  In contrast to skin sensitization where cysteine and lysine are both key nucleophiles, experimental work has suggested that some respiratory sensitizers appear to preferentially bind to lysine; (Hettick et al., 2012, Lalko et al., 2012, Holsapple et al., 2006, Hopkins et al., 2005) however, an in chemico analysis of a larger set of respiratory sensitizers indicates lack of a simple division between the reactivity preferences of the two types of sensitizers, showing that certain classes displayed a lysine preference, for example, anhydrides, whereas others, such as diisocyanates, do not. (Dik et al., 2016)  While respiratory sensitizers and skin sensitizers can both bind to cellular and serum proteins in separate cultures, a study comparing the binding profiles of both classes in co-culture systems found that skin sensitizers preferentially bind cellular proteins, while respiratory sensitizers preferentially bind serum proteins.

TPP could affect peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &gamma; (PPAR&gamma;) and liver X receptors (LXRs) to induce lipid abnormalities . It also could modulate saturation of phospholipids (Hu et al., 2020) and increase the cholesterol or triglyceride concentrations in bloods. Under this circumstance, it is extraordinarily exigent to assess the health risk of TPP."@en ;

  dc:description "Organophosphate and carbamate insecticides are prototypical AChE inhibitors. The OP and carbamate pesticides were synthesized specifically to act as inhibitors of AChE, with OPs developed from early nerve agents (e.g., sarin) and carbamate pesticides based on the natural plant alkaloid physostigmine (Ecobichon 2001). 	A positive and significant correlation between the log of the Eserine IC50 (in vitro) for AChE inhibition and the log Km value for the AChE in the fish and crustacea species has been reported, explaining 92% of the variation in enzyme inhibition (Monserrat and Bianchini, 2001). Similar success was found in relating the rate constants for inhibition of AChE in housefly and the pseudo first-order hydrolysis rate constant for active forms of OPs (Fukuto 1990).    	The open literature includes many studies on vertebrate and invertebrate species that demonstrate a clear dependence of AChE activity on the dose or concentration of the substance with increased concentrations leading to an increase in the inhibition of AChE (e.g., fish ( Karen et al., 2001), birds (Hudson et al., 1984 (see dimethoate and disulfoton), Grue and Shipley 1984; and Al-Zubaidy et al., 2011); cladocera (Barata et al., 2004); nematodes (Rajini et al., 2008); rodents (Roberts et al., 1988; and mollusk (Bianco et al., 2011)). 	The open literature includes many studies on vertebrate and invertebrate species that demonstrate a clear relationship between increasing AChE inhibition as duration of exposure increases (e.g., amphibians ( Venturino et al., 2001); fish (Rao 2008; Ferrari et al., 2004); insects (Rose and Sparks 1984); birds (Ludke 1985; Grue and Shipley 1984); annelids (Reddy and Rao 2008); cladocera (Barata et al., 2004)). 	Rao et al. 2008 exposed the estuarine fish Oreochromis mossambicus to a 24 h LC50 concentration of chlorpyrifos and reported that it took 6 hr to reach &gt;40% AChE inhibition and 24 hr to reach 90% AChE inhibition. It took &gt;100 days to recover to normal AChE levels when fish were placed in clean water. 	A time course study of earthworms (Eisenis foetida) exposed to the 48 hr LC50 of profenofos found a significant relationship (between increases in percent inhibition of AChE and increase in time of exposure from 8-48 hrs (Chakra Reddy and Rao 2008)."@en ;

In parallel, the antioxidant defensive mechanisms were lowered in COVID-19 patients (Pincemail, Cavalier et al. 2021). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress are known to activate inflammasomes (Cruz, Rinna et al. 2007, Martinon 2010, Kauppinen, Niskanen et al. 2012, Abderrazak, Syrovets et al. 2015). &nbsp;Inflammasomes are critical components of innate immune system that induce secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL1B and IL18 upon activation (Martinon, Burns et al. 2002, Kelley, Jeltema et al. 2019). In the study by Lage and colleagues, aberrant levels of oxidative stress hallmarks (such as mitochondrial superoxide and lipid peroxidation) with concomitant NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL1B secretion were observed in monocytes of COVID-19 patients (Lage, Amaral et al. 2021).

  dc:description "High aspect ratio nanoparticles are not completely engulfed by macrophages due to their long shape (&gt; 10&micro;m) [8, 10].    Some studies analysed the effect of the length of nanoparticles (NPs) on the capacity of macrophages to phagocytose them.  The study of Sweeney et al 2015 demonstrated that treatment of primary human alveolar macrophages by multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) similar in term of diameter, specific surface area and purity but differ by their length differentially alter phagocytosis [6]. Indeed, treatment by the longer CNT (median length 19.3 &micro;m) induced frustrated phagocytosis and receptor expression (MARCO) as well as decreased phagocytic ability and migratory capacity in a more extend manner than the shorter CNT (median length 1.1 &micro;m) [6]. Another study analysed the effect of particle morphology on the ability of human monocytic cell line THP-1 to engulf carbon nanotubes [9]. Cells were treated for 24h by two longs CNTs (men length 13 and 36 &micro;m, dimeter 84.89 and 165.02 nm), two tangled CNTs (length 1-5 and 5-20 &micro;m, dimeter 14.84 and 10.40 nm) and one short CNT (length 1-2 &micro;m, diameter 25.7 nm). The authors observed by light microscopy that only the two long CNTs are protruding from the cells. A study on THP-1 cells treated for 4h was conducted with silver nanowires that possess similar diameter but different length (average length: 3, 5, 10, 14 and 28 &micro;m) [8]. The authors observed by bright-field microscopy that the shorter NPs (3 and 5) were fully enclosed by macrophages, while the longer NPs (14 and 28) caused frustrated phagocytosis. In addition, injection of NPs in mouse pleural cavity followed by pleural lavage demonstrated that the shorter (3 and 5) were fully phagocytosed whereas the longer (10) caused frustrated phagocytosis. The authors observed differences between in vitro and in vivo studies in term of sensitivity for the determination of the length threshold that caused frustrated phagocytosis [8]. Finally, Padmore et al showed by time-lapse video microscopy that immortalized MH-S murine alveolar macrophages were able to internalized short glass fibres (mean length 7 &micro;m) whereas the longer fibres were not (mean length 39.3&nbsp;&micro;m) [7].    All together, these studies could suggest that the threshold for frustrated phagocytosis should be around 10 &micro;m, close to the suggestion formulated by Donaldson et al that fibres longer than 15 &micro;m cause this process [10]."@en ;

  dc:description "The motivation behind building the AOP&nbsp;was methodological. Our team has recently developed molecular causal networks for developmental cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity in zebrafish (doi.org/10.1021/acs.chemrestox.0c00095). These networks are highly curated, but rather large, going from adverse outcomes on the organ level upstream to wherever evidence takes us (many times finishing at what would be called MIEs). As there are many causal networks already present on the http://causalbionet.com/ (mostly for humans and for lung conditions), we were wondering how the rich knowledge available in causal pathways could be translated to AOPs. The AOP described in this document is one such example.&nbsp;"@en ;

  dc:description "With a surface area of ~100 m2 and ventilated by 10,000 to 20,000 liters of air per day (National Research Council, 1988; Frohlich et al., 2016), the lungs are a major barrier that protect the body from a host of external factors that enter the respiratory system and may cause lung pathologies. Mucociliary clearance (MCC) is a key aspect of the innate immune&nbsp;defense against airborne pathogens and inhaled particles and is governed by the concerted action of its functional components, the cilia and the airway surface liquid (ASL), which comprises mucus and the periciliary layer (Bustamante-Marin and Ostrowski, 2017). In healthy subjects, &ge;10 mL&nbsp;airway secretions are continuously produced and transported daily by the mucociliary escalator. Disturbances in any of the processes regulating ASL volume, mucus production, mucus viscoelastic properties, or ciliary function can cause MCC dysfunction and are linked to airway diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, both of which bear a significant risk of increased morbidity and mortality. The mechanism by which exposure to inhaled toxicants might lead to mucus hypersecretion and thereby impact pulmonary function has already been mapped in AOP148 on decreased lung function.&nbsp;However, whether an exposure-related decline in lung function is solely related to excessive production of mucus is debatable, particularly in light of the close relationship between mucus, ciliary function, and efficient MCC. To date, no single event has been attributed to MCC impairment, and it is likely that events described in this AOP as well as in AOP148, AOP424, and AOP425 have to culminate to lead to&nbsp;decreased lung function."@en ;

  dc:description "Established regulatory guideline studies for inhalation toxicity focus on evident clinical signs of systemic toxicity, including death, or organ-specific toxicity following acute and (sub)chronic exposure respectively. In toxicological and safety pharmacological studies with airborne test items targeting the airways or the lungs as a whole, lung function is a relevant endpoint for the characterization of potential adverse events (OECD, 2018a; Hoymann, 2012). Hence, the AO &ldquo;decreased lung function&rdquo; is relevant for regulatory decision-making in the context of (sub)chronic exposure (OECD, 2018b; OECD, 2018c).  Regulatory relevance of the AO &ldquo;decreased lung function&rdquo; is evident when looking at the increased risk of diseases in humans following inhalation exposure, and because of its links to other comorbidities and mortality.  To aid diagnosis and monitoring of fibrosis, current recommendations include both the recording of potential environmental and occupational exposures as well as an assessment of lung function (Baumgartner et al., 2000). The latter typically confirms decreased lung function as demonstrated by a loss of lung volume. As the disease progresses, dyspnea and lung function worsen, and the prognosis is directly linked to the decline in FVC (Meltzer and Noble, 2008).   Chronic exposure to cigarette smoke and other combustion-derived particles results in the development of COPD. COPD is diagnosed on the basis of spirometry results as laid out in the ATS/ERS Task Force documents on the standardization of lung function tests and their interpretation (Pellegrino et al., 2005; Culver et al., 2017, Graham et al., 2019). Rapid rates of decline in the lung function parameter FEV1 are linked to higher risk of exacerbations, increased hospitalization and early death (Wise et al., 2006; Celli, 2010). Reduced FEV1 also poses a risk for serious cardiovascular events and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease (Sin et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2015).  &nbsp;"@en ;

  dc:description "The AHR can be activated by several structurally diverse chemicals, but binds preferentially to planar halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Dioxin-like compounds (DLCs), which include polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and certain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), are among the most potent AHR ligands[38]. Only a subset of PCDD, PCDF and PCB congeners has been shown to bind to the AHR and cause toxic effects to those elicited by TCDD. Until recently, TCDD was considered to be the most potent DLC in birds[39]; however, recent reports indicate that 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (PeCDF) is more potent than TCDD in some species of birds.[40][13][41][21][42][43] When screened for their ability to induce aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) activity, dioxins with chlorine atoms at a minimum of three out of the four lateral ring positions, and with at least one non-chlorinated ring position are the most active[44]. Of the dioxin-like PCBs, non-ortho congeners are the most toxicologically active, while mono-ortho PCBs are generally less potent[45][9]. Chlorine substitution at ortho positions increases the energetic costs of assuming the coplanar conformation required for binding to the AHR [45]. Thus, a smaller proportion of mono-ortho PCB molecules are able to bind to the AHR and elicit toxic effects, resulting in reduced potency of these congeners. Other PCB congeners, such as di-ortho substituted PCBs, are very weak AHR agonists and do not likely contribute to dioxin-like effects [9].   	Contrary to studies of birds and mammals, even the most potent mono-ortho PCBs bind to AhRs of fishes with very low affinity, if at all (Abnet et al 1999; Doering et al 2014; 2015; Eisner et al 2016; Van den Berg et al 1998).   The role of the AHR in mediating the toxic effects of planar hydrophobic contaminants has been well studied, however the endogenous role of the AHR is less clear [1]. Some endogenous and natural substances, including prostaglandin PGG2 and the tryptophan derivatives indole-3-carbinol, 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ) and kynurenic acid can bind to and activate the AHR. [6][46][47][48][49] The AHR is thought to have important endogenous roles in reproduction, liver and heart development, cardiovascular function, immune function and cell cycle regulation [50][38][51][52][53][54][46][55][56][57] and activation of the AHR by DLCs may therefore adversely affect these processes."@en ;

Rapid rates of decline in the lung function parameter FEV1 are linked to higher risk of exacerbations, increased hospitalization and early death (Wise et al., 2006; Celli, 2010). Reduced FEV1 also poses a risk for serious cardiovascular events and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease (Sin et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2015).  &nbsp;"@en ;

  dc:description "Regulatory Significance of the Adverse Outcome: The International Conference on Harmonization regulatory guidelines for embryo-fetal developmental toxicity testing (ICH 2005) require studies in both a rodent and a non-rodent species, usually rat and rabbit. The current two-species testing paradigm was developed in response to the pandemic of phocomelia associated with maternal exposure to thalidomide during early pregnancy [Schardein 2000]. Dose ranges of thalidomide that were teratogenic in the rabbit induced embryo-fetal loss in the rat [Janer et al. 2008]. This observation is consistent with current knowledge that the specific manifestations of embryo-fetal toxicity may in general vary greatly between species, and even between strains within the same species [Hurtt et al. 2003; Janer et al. 2008; Theunissen et al. 2016].  OECD Test Guideline No. 414 (Prenatal Developmental Toxicity Study) and Test Guideline No. 443 (Extended One-Generation Reproduction Toxicity Study) test for the endpoints relevant to this AOP. TG 414 is an OECD validated developmental toxicity test designed to provide general information concerning the effects of prenatal exposure on the pregnant test animal and on the developing organism. It is intended for use with rodents (rat, preferably) and non-rodent (rabbit, preferably). Exposure is administered to pregnant animals at least from implantation through organogenesis.&nbsp;  OECD Test Guideline 443 is an extended one generation toxicity test that looks for developmental and reproductive effects after chemical exposure administered pre- and postnatal. &nbsp;Systemic toxicity in pregnant and lactating females in addition to young and adult offspring is also evaluated.&nbsp;  The full text of the guidelines can be found at https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/test-no-414-prenatal-development-toxicity-study_9789264070820-en and https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/environment/test-no-443-extended-one-generation-reproductive-toxicity-study_9789264185371-en ."@en ;

  dc:description "https://aopwiki.org/wiki/index.php/File:KleinstreuerKnudsenAOPVascularDisruption.jpg  Functionalization of the ToxCast pVDC predictive signature  The ToxCast putative Vascular Disrupting Chemicals (pVDC) signature will be described here and parts will be incorporated into the relevant Key Events sections.  The sectors of the ToxPI are color-represented by features from ToxCast HTS assays indicated by the target of the assays, the characteristics as follows.  Vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1): the pVDC signature aggregates assays from the BioMAP Systems Predictive Toxicology panel [Houck et al., 2009, Kunkel et al., 2004] focusing here on chemical disruption of endothelial VCAM1 expression following stimulation by cytokines-growth factors. This assay endpoint is an in vitro surrogate for inflammatory cell recruitment per endothelial dysfunction and has been probed across five different cell systems: 4H (HUVECs stimulated with IL-4 + histamine); 3C (HUVECs stimulated with IL-1&beta; + TNF&alpha; + IFN&upsih;); CASM3C (primary human coronary artery smooth muscle cells stimulated with IL-1&beta; + TNF&alpha; + IFN&upsih;); LPS (HUVECs co-cultured with monocytes and stimulated with bacterial endotoxin); and hDFCGF (human dermal fibroblasts stimulated with IL-1&beta; + TNF&alpha; + IFN&upsih; and EGF + bFGF + PDGF-BB)[Knudsen and Kleinstreuer, 2011, Kleinstreuer et al., 2014].  Angiogenic cytokines and chemokines: the pVDC signature aggregates features for LPS-induced TNF&alpha; protein expression (see BioMAP descriptor above), nuclear factor-kappa B (NFkB) mediated reporter gene activation (Attagene; cis- configuration), and caspase 8 enzymatic activity (NovaScreen; inhibition or activation). TNF&alpha; is a proinflammatory cytokine that can promote angiogenesis indirectly through NFkB-mediated expression of angiogenic growth factors, or inhibit angiogenesis by direct effects on endothelial proliferation and survival. The pVDC signature also aggregates features for signaling activity of the pro-angiogenic cytokines interleukin-1 alpha (IL1a, a macrophage-derived activator of TNF&alpha;) and interleukin 6 (IL6). These cytokines act through the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) IL1R and IL6R, respectively. CXCL8 (chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 8), formerly known as interleukin 8 (IL8), is angiogenic through its cognate GPCRs (CXCR1, CXCR2). In contrast to CXCL8, the chemokines CXCL9 (alias MIG, monokine induced by IFN&upsih;) and CXCL10 (alias IP10, interferon-inducible cytokine IP-10) are considered anti-angiogenic through their cognate receptor, CXCR3.  Angiogenic growth factors: FGFs and VEGFs exert their effects on endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation via specific binding to receptor tyrosine kinases VEGFR and FGFR. The pVDC signature has features for liganding VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and VEGFR3 based on receptor kinase activity (RTK, inhibition or activation) from the NovaScreen biochemical profile [Sipes et al. 2013] and for down-regulation of VEGFR2 expression in the 4H BioMAP system (HUVECs stimulated with IL-4 + histamine, B). VEGFR1 is a non-signaling VEGF-A decoy receptor that can be cleaved from the cell surface; VEGFR2 is the most important VEGF-A receptor and a master switch for developmental angiogenesis; and VEGFR3 is a VEGF-C receptor up-regulated by Notch signals. The pVDC signature includes features for the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) and Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 alpha (HIF1a) that are upstream regulators of VEGF gene expression during ischemia or hypoxia. HIF1a and AhR are measured in reporter assays (Attagene). In addition to HIF1a and AhR, the pVDC signature has features for the estrogen receptor alpha (ERa), also a trans-activator of VEGF expression. This included human ERa binding activity (NovaScreen), ERa reporter trans-activation (Attagene) and ERE (estrogen responsive element) reporter cis-activation (Attagene).  Angiogenic sprouting: the ephrins (EFNA1 and EFNB2 in particular) couple VEGF signaling to angiogenic sprouting during early development of the embryonic vasculature (vasculogenesis, angiogenesis). The ToxCast pVDC signature included features for EPH-receptor tyrosine kinase biochemical activity (increased or decreased) for receptors EPHA1, EPHA2, EPHB1 and EPHB2 via their cognate cell membrane-anchored ligands (EFNAs). In contrast to the ephrin system, a number of chemicals had activity on diverse assays for urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA). That system, consisting of uPA (4 features) and its GPI-anchored receptor, uPAR (8 features) - both assayed in the BioMAP System [Kleinstreuer et al. 2014], functions in VEGFR2-induced changes to focal adhesion and extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation at the leading edge of endothelial cells during angiogenic sprouting. Binding of uPA to uPAR results in serine-protease conversion of plasminogen to plasmin that initiates a proteolytic cascade leading to degradation of the basement membrane and angiogenic sprouting. The uPA proteolytic cascade is suppressed by the serine protease inhibitor, endothelial plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI1). The PAI1/uPA/uPAR assays report chemical effects on the system (up or down) across diverse cellular platforms: 4H, 3C, CASM3C, and hDFCGF noted above; BE3C (human bronchial epithelial cells stimulated with IL-1&beta; + TNF&alpha; + IFN&upsih;); and KF3T (human keratinocytes + fibroblasts stimulated with IL-1&beta; + TNF&alpha; + IFN&upsih; + TGF-&beta;). The pVDC signature has features for thrombomodulin (THBD) and the thromboxane A2 (TBXA2) receptor that participate in the regulation of endothelial migration during angiogenic sprouting. THBD is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that mediates regulator of uPA/uPAR and TBXA2 is an angiogenic eicosanoid generated by endothelial cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) following VEGF- or bFGF stimulation. THBD protein expression was monitored in the 3C and CASM3C BioMAP systems (up, down) and TBXA2 was assayed for ligand binding in the NovaScreen platform.  Endothelial cell migration and proliferation: the pVDC signature includes assays for human primary vascular cultures (endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells). Assays for nuclear localization of beta-catenin (CTNB) are based on the principle that nuclear translocation activates pathways important for endothelial cell migration, proliferation and survival during capillary network formation in HUVEC cells [Muller et al. 2002; Masckauchan et al. 2005].  Vascular stabilization: The signature has features for transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-b), which regulates vascular morphogenesis and integrity, and for Tie2 - a receptor tyrosine kinase activated by the angiopoietins (ANG1, ANG2) that function stabilize nascent vasculature. The pVDC signature has features for the anti-angiogenic phosphatases PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog), PTPN11 (tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 11) and PTPN12, and endothelial-specific receptor tyrosine protein phosphatase beta (PTPRB). Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 1/2/9 aggregate features on biochemical activity and cellular function of zinc-dependent endopeptidases MMP1, MMP2 and MMP9 that facilitate angiogenesis through ECM degradation by activated endothelial cells."@en ;

  dc:description "Chemical effects on VEGF-A binding to VEGFR2 has been demonstrated for 6 different inhibitors using recombinant VEGF-A(165) [Gustafsdottir et al. 2008]. Among the inhibitors were DNA/RNA aptamers, neutralizing antibodies directed against VEGF-A or VEGFR2, recombinant competitive protein, and a low molecular weight synthetic molecule. A pharmacological panel of small molecule inhibitors of VEGFR inhibitors is known, having varied activities on VEGFR2 and other members of the same receptor tyrosine kinase family as the VEGF receptors, including the platelet-derived growth factor receptor &beta; (PDGFR-&beta;). These compounds include Vatalanib (VEGFR2/PDGFR&beta;/c-kit inhibitor), Sunitinib (VEGFR1/VEGFR2/PDGFR inhibitor), and Semaxinib (VEGFR2 inhibitor).  Vatalanib, also known by the code name PTK787, is a potent vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits VEGFR2/KDR and VEGFR1/Flt-1 with the half maximal inhibition concentration IC50 values of 0.037 &mu;M and 0.077 &mu;M, respectively [Wood et al. 2000]. It also inhibits to a lesser degree PDGFR-&beta;. Liganding VEGFR2 leads to receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues, which initiates signal transduction [Kendall et al. 1999]. Using a double antibody chemiluminescence assay, PTK787 was shown to block VEGF-induced auto-phosphorylation of VEGFR2 with an IC50 of 0.017 &mu;M in human endothelial cells (HUVECs) and concentration-dependent suppression of endothelial migration and tumorigenic formation of microvessels [Wood et al. 2000].  &nbsp;"@en ;

  dc:description "Vertebrate embryo-fetal cardiovascular development involves multiple steps. The importance of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) in this process is well documented and has been the subject of multiple review papers (Brade et al., 2018; Duong &amp; Waxman, 2021; Nakajima, 2019; Perl &amp; Waxman, 2019; Stefanovic &amp; Zaffran, 2017; S. Wang &amp; Moise, 2019).   Cardiac progenitors  During early gastrulation at E6.5 in mice, the first cardiac progenitors are formed around the primitive streak and migrate anterior laterally to form the cardiac crescent to become the first heart field (FHF) at E7-7.5 (Stefanovic &amp; Zaffran, 2017). An evolutionary approach to cardiac development related to the vertebrate heart was reviewed by P&eacute;rez-Pomares et al. in 2009 (P&eacute;rez-Pomares et al., 2009).  To make the cardiac crescent and primary heart tube, weak or no ATRA signaling is sufficient (Nakajima, 2019). At this stage of cardiogenesis, ATRA controls the cardiac progenitor pool size (Keegan et al., 2005; S. Wang &amp; Moise, 2019). This early requirement of ATRA is conserved across species and restricts ventricular and atrial specification within the cardiac progenitor pool (Duong &amp; Waxman, 2021). Before the primitive heart tube is formed, ATRA signaling is symmetrical (Nakajima, 2019).  Tube formation and anterior/posterior heart segments before looping  The heart tube is derived from the FHF at E8 in mice or after three weeks in human development (Brade et al., 2018). As the cardiac crescent folds, it will form the primitive heart tube and consequently fusion and systemic circulation can emerge (S. Wang &amp; Moise, 2019). The FHF mainly will give rise to the left ventricle. The linear heart tube expands by cell proliferation and recruitment of additional cells that contribute to the arterial and venous poles of the heart tube and are derived from the second heart field (SHF) (Brade et al., 2018). The SHF mainly contributes to the outflow tract (OFT), the right ventricle, and part of the atria (Brade et al., 2018).   The posterior mesoderm and cardiac precursors produce ATRA, which at this stage is patterned in a caudo-rostral gradient determining the inflow-outflow poles of the heart tube (S. Wang &amp; Moise, 2019).   Specification Second Heart Field  The SHF is specified by ISL1 (Islet-1, transcription factor and SHF specifier) positive cells and contributes to the sub-pulmonary myocardium (S. Wang &amp; Moise, 2019).   Higher levels of ATRA promote posterior precursors of the FHF and SHF committing to the inflow tract (Hochgreb et al., 2003; Niederreither et al., 2001; Ryckebusch et al., 2008a; Sirbu et al., 2008; S. Wang &amp; Moise, 2019). Subsequently, ATRA restricts SHF boundaries and stimulates a SHF sublineage giving rise to the outflow tract (OFT) (P. Li et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2016; Nakajima, 2019; S. Wang &amp; Moise, 2019).   Heart tube looping / outflow tract development  As the heart tube grows, looping will occur at E9 in mice (S. Wang &amp; Moise, 2019). During this process the straight heart tube will be remodeled by forming a coiling loop to eventually form a multichambered heart.  ATRA receptors (RARs) have been shown to be essential for cardiac looping, left-right patterning, and inflow tract development (Perl &amp; Waxman, 2019). For proper OFT development in mice, Hox genes are necessary which are responsive to ATRA (Perl &amp; Waxman, 2019).   Chamber formation   Chamber septation emerges at E10 in mice (S. Wang &amp; Moise, 2019). Interaction of cardiomyocytes with epicardial, endocardial and cardiac neural crest cells (Brade et al., 2018).   ATRA is needed for the posterior heart segment to become the primitive atrium and sinus venosus (Nakajima, 2019). At later stages, ATRA stimulates growth and maturation of the ventriculi (Nakajima, 2019).  Proepicardium / Coronary vessel development  The proepicardial cells are formed between E9.5 and E11.5 in mice, migrate from a location near the sinus venosus to cover the primitive heart tube, and will form the epicardium which is the outer layer of the heart (Brade et al., 2018; S. Wang &amp; Moise, 2019).  Mesenchymal subepicardial cells and epicardial derived cells will merge and differentiate to the coronary plexus around E11.5 in mice and subsequently coronary vessels form around the ventricle until E13.5 (Brade et al., 2018).  Several lines of evidence indicate that precision in ATRA levels and timing is important in coronary vasculature development and are reviewed by Wang and Moise (S. Wang &amp; Moise, 2019). Coronary vasculature defects resulting from perturbed ATRA homeostasis usually concurs with myocardial expansion, vasculature development and fetal erythropoiesis (S. Wang &amp; Moise, 2019).  myocardial expansion (ventricular wall expansion)  The FHF contributes primarily to the myocardium (S. Wang &amp; Moise, 2019). ATRA signaling in epicardial(-derived) cells stimulates a signal promoting myocardium growth (Brade et al., 2011; S. Wang &amp; Moise, 2019). The embryonic liver is thought to contribute to myocardial expansion through erythropoietin (EPO) secretion, which is a direct target of ATRA in the liver, and in turn induces insulin growth factor 2 (IGF2) release from the epicardium (Brade et al., 2011; S. Wang &amp; Moise, 2019). Inactivation of EPO or its receptor resulted in ventricular hypoplasia (S. Wang &amp; Moise, 2019; Wu et al., 1999).   Cardiac neural crest orientation and positioning   Cardiac neural crest cells (cNCCs) mainly provide patterning signals that contribute to the aortic arteries, OFT/aortopulmonary development and septation, and formation of a functional myocardium (Brade et al., 2018; Stefanovic &amp; Zaffran, 2017; S. Wang &amp; Moise, 2019). Additionally, cNCCs contribute to the heart valves and parasympathetic innervation (Brade et al., 2018; Stefanovic &amp; Zaffran, 2017; S. Wang &amp; Moise, 2019). Furthermore, preotic cNCC derived precursors contribute to vascular smooth muscle cell formation and eventually to proximal coronary arteries (Stefanovic &amp; Zaffran, 2017). ATRA influences the cNCC migration and differentiation, which contribute to the aorticopulmonary septum / OFT (el Robrini et al., 2016; Ma et al., 2016; S. Wang &amp; Moise, 2019)."@en ;

  dc:description "The AHR can be activated by several structurally diverse chemicals, but binds preferentially to planar halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Dioxin-like compounds (DLCs), which include polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and certain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), are among the most potent AHR ligands[38]. Only a subset of PCDD, PCDF and PCB congeners has been shown to bind to the AHR and cause toxic effects to those elicited by TCDD. Until recently, TCDD was considered to be the most potent DLC in birds[39]; however, recent reports indicate that 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (PeCDF) is more potent than TCDD in some species of birds.[40][13][41][21][42][43] When screened for their ability to induce aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) activity, dioxins with chlorine atoms at a minimum of three out of the four lateral ring positions, and with at least one non-chlorinated ring position are the most active[44]. Of the dioxin-like PCBs, non-ortho congeners are the most toxicologically active, while mono-ortho PCBs are generally less potent[45][9]. Chlorine substitution at ortho positions increases the energetic costs of assuming the coplanar conformation required for binding to the AHR [45]. Thus, a smaller proportion of mono-ortho PCB molecules are able to bind to the AHR and elicit toxic effects, resulting in reduced potency of these congeners. Other PCB congeners, such as di-ortho substituted PCBs, are very weak AHR agonists and do not likely contribute to dioxin-like effects [9].   	Contrary to studies of birds and mammals, even the most potent mono-ortho PCBs bind to AhRs of fishes with very low affinity, if at all (Abnet et al 1999; Doering et al 2014; 2015; Eisner et al 2016; Van den Berg et al 1998).   The role of the AHR in mediating the toxic effects of planar hydrophobic contaminants has been well studied, however the endogenous role of the AHR is less clear [1]. Some endogenous and natural substances, including prostaglandin PGG2 and the tryptophan derivatives indole-3-carbinol, 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ) and kynurenic acid can bind to and activate the AHR. [6][46][47][48][49] The AHR is thought to have important endogenous roles in reproduction, liver and heart development, cardiovascular function, immune function and cell cycle regulation [50][38][51][52][53][54][46][55][56][57] and activation of the AHR by DLCs may therefore adversely affect these processes."@en ;

  dc:source <https://h2020-sbd4nano.github.io/sbd-data-aopwiki/models/> ;
  dc:description "Breast cancer is a frequent disease, responsible of 2&nbsp;262 419 new cases and 684 996 deaths in 2020 in the world, making it the deadliest female cancer (Bray et al., 2018). In 70% of cases, the disease is localized, and the prognosis is favorable with a 5-year survival of 99%. However, once the disease spreads (lymph nodes, metastasis), survival is severely altered with a 5-year survival rate of 26% in case of metastasis (Henley et al., 2020). It is therefore of paramount importance to understand the mechanisms of metastasis in breast cancer.  Amongst risk factors clearly established, including obesity, genetic mutations and hormonal exposure, the importance of the role of the environment is currently emerging (Koual et al., 2020 Nov 17). In an epidemiologic study, we found a positive association between the concentrations of 2.3.7.8-TCDD (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxine) in the&nbsp;adipose tissue&nbsp;surrounding the tumors, and breast cancer metastasis in overweight and obese patients (Koual et al., 2019). Moreover, we have shown that, using both&nbsp;in vivo&nbsp;and&nbsp;in vitro&nbsp;models,&nbsp;TCDD&nbsp;exposure could promote an aggressive phenotype to breast cancer cells, thus favoring the formation of metastatic cells (Koual et al., 2021). TCDD is a potent ligand of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a transcriptional factor involved notably in the metabolism of&nbsp;xenobiotics&nbsp;(Larigot et al., 2022). Hence, the impact of the environment on breast cancer aggressiveness could be mediated by the activation of the AhR.  Interest is growing on the role of the AhR in breast cancer. First, the AhR is often overexpressed in different breast cancer cell lines (Zudaire et al., 2008,&nbsp;Kim et al., 2000 Nov 16,&nbsp;Li et al., 2014). Interestingly, the level of expression can be correlated to the stage or the molecular sub-type of the disease (Zudaire et al., 2008,&nbsp;Zhao et al., 2013). Second, the AhR pathway has been associated with different pro-metastatic features in breast cancer, such as resistance to apoptosis,&nbsp;invasiveness, modified cell cycle, migration and proliferation (Zudaire et al., 2008,&nbsp;Goode et al., 2013 Dec 15,&nbsp;Kanno et al., 2006). Triple negative cell lines, breast cancer cell lines with the worse prognosis (not over-expressing Her2 receptor or hormonal receptors), over-expressing the AhR seem to develop stem-like characteristics, favoring epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and thus metastasis (Stanford et al., 2016). Thirdly, the AhR could be involved in the resistance of breast cancer to treatments (Goode et al., 2013 Dec 15,&nbsp;Goode et al., 2014): after AhR knockout, Goode&nbsp;et al.&nbsp;found enhanced sensitivity of paclitaxel (a drug targeting cancer cells) in triple negative breast cancer, a cancer particularly difficult to treat (Goode et al., 2014). Breast cancer patients expressing estrogen receptors (ER-positive) in their cancer cells, can benefit from an efficient endocrine therapy, which greatly improves their survival. Activation of the AhR can lead to the loss of expression of the ER alpha and therefore to the loss of a potential therapeutic target (Safe et al., 2000 Jul).  The mechanisms linking the activation of the AhR to breast cancer aggressiveness are still unclear. Based on the AOP-wiki database (https://aopwiki.org/, last accessed March 2022), the central repository for AOPs, the AhR has already been proposed in several AOPs, but never in one characterized by the AO breast cancer metastasis. Likewise, an AOP linking an MIE to breast cancer aggressiveness has never been proposed. From our expertise and available knowledge, we hypothesize that the activation of the AhR could be a MIE leading to breast cancer metastasis (AO) through different KEs and KERs."@en ;

  dc:description "The Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) holds substantial regulatory significance as a structured framework for understanding and predicting the biological sequence of events leading from DNA damage&nbsp;to a metastatic breast cancer. By elucidating the causal relationships between key events along the pathway, AOP&nbsp;offer a comprehensive understanding of toxicological mechanisms and provide a basis for informed decision-making in risk assessment and regulatory decision-making. AOPs facilitate the integration of diverse scientific data, enabling regulators to evaluate the potential impact of chemical exposures on human health and the environment. These pathways empower the development of targeted testing strategies, alternative methods, and safer chemical design, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of risk assessment and regulatory policies.  Metastasis, the process by which cancer cells spread from the primary tumor to distant sites in the body, holds significant regulatory importance in cancer biology and beyond. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms underlying metastasis is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies and improving patient outcomes. Here are some key aspects of its regulatory significance:  1. Therapeutic Target Identification: Regulatory pathways governing metastasis represent potential targets for therapeutic intervention. By elucidating the signaling networks and molecular drivers involved in metastatic processes such as cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis, researchers can identify druggable targets for the development of anti-metastatic therapies. Targeting these pathways can potentially inhibit the spread of cancer cells and prevent the formation of secondary tumors, thereby improving patient survival and quality of life.  2. Biomarker Discovery: Metastasis-specific biomarkers have diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications. Regulatory molecules or genetic signatures associated with metastatic potential can serve as biomarkers for predicting patient outcomes, stratifying patients for personalized treatment approaches, and monitoring disease progression. Biomarker discovery efforts aim to identify molecular signatures indicative of metastatic propensity, enabling early detection of metastasis and guiding treatment decisions.  3. Therapeutic Resistance Mechanisms: Metastatic tumors often exhibit resistance to conventional therapies, posing a significant clinical challenge. Regulatory mechanisms underlying therapy resistance in metastatic cancer cells, such as alterations in drug efflux pumps, DNA repair pathways, and apoptotic signaling, need to be elucidated. Understanding these resistance mechanisms can inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies to overcome drug resistance and improve treatment efficacy in metastatic cancer patients.  4. Microenvironment Modulation: The tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in regulating metastasis by providing a supportive niche for cancer cell survival, proliferation, and dissemination. Regulatory factors within the tumor microenvironment, including stromal cells, immune cells, extracellular matrix components, and signaling molecules, influence metastatic progression. Targeting the tumor microenvironment to disrupt pro-metastatic signaling pathways or enhance anti-tumor immune responses represents a promising therapeutic approach to inhibit metastasis and improve treatment outcomes.  5. Epigenetic Regulation: Epigenetic alterations, such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA dysregulation, contribute to metastatic phenotypes by modulating gene expression programs associated with cell motility, invasion, and metastatic colonization. Understanding the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms driving metastasis can provide insights into novel therapeutic targets and strategies for epigenetic therapy in metastatic cancer.  In summary, metastasis exerts significant regulatory influence on cancer progression and treatment response. Elucidating the molecular and cellular regulatory mechanisms governing metastasis is essential for the development of targeted therapies, biomarker-driven treatment strategies, and interventions to overcome therapeutic resistance. By targeting metastasis-specific pathways and processes, researchers aim to improve patient outcomes and ultimately reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with metastatic cancer."@en ;

  dc:description "It is well documented that ionizing radiation( (eg.&nbsp;X-rays, gamma, photons, alpha, beta, neutrons, heavy ions)&nbsp;leads to energy deposition on the atoms and molecules of the substrate. Many studies, have demonstrated that the type of radiation and distance from source has an impact on the pattern of energy deposition (Alloni, et al. 2014). High linear energy transfer (LET) radiation has been associated with higher-energy deposits (Liamsuwan et al., 2014) that are more densely-packed and cause more complex effects within the particle track (Hada and Georgakilas, 2008; Okayasu, 2012ab; Lorat et al., 2015; Nikitaki et al., 2016) in comparison to low LET radiation. Parameters such as mean lineal energy, dose mean lineal energy, frequency mean specific energy and dose mean specific energy can impact track structure of the traversed energy into a medium (Friedland et al., 2017). The detection of energy deposition by ionizing radiation can be demonstrated with the use of fluorescent nuclear track detectors (FNTDs). FNTDs used in conjunction with fluorescent microscopy, are able to visualize radiation tracks produced by ionizing radiation (Niklas et al., 2013; Kodaira et al., 2015; Sawakuchi and Akselrod, 2016). In addition, these FNTD chips can quantify the LET of primary and secondary radiation tracks up to 0.47 keV/um (Sawakuchi and Akselrod, 2016). This co-visualization of the radiation tracks and the cell markers enable the mapping of the radiation trajectory to specific cellular compartments, and the identification of accrued damage (Niklas et al., 2013; Kodaira et al., 2015).

  dc:description "Alcoholic beverages are classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer(IARC) as Group 1 carcinogens. Studies have reported alcohol consumption to be a&nbsp; risk factor for breast cancer in women(Room R&nbsp;et al,&nbsp;2005). A woman drinking an average of two units of alcohol per day has an 8% higher risk of developing breast cancer than a woman who drinks an average of one unit of alcohol per day[2]. Alcohol is metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase to acetaldehyde which is a mutagen. Various theories have been proposed which explain the mutagenicity of alcohol. Among them, the most relevant one for carcinoma of the breast has been proposed by Purohita et al, suggesting an alcohol-induced inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene BRCA1 and increased estrogen&nbsp;Responsiveness in breast tissues(Purohit V&nbsp;et al, 2005). Boffetta and Hashibe list plausible mechanisms of breast cancer as a result of the genotoxic effect of acetaldehyde-induced increased estrogen concentration(Boffetta P&nbsp;et al 2006).&nbsp;It has also been found that alcohol stimulates the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), because of which there is distant metastasis (Forsyth C. B.&nbsp;et al 2010). However, this mechanism needs to be elucidated in detail.  MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding, single-stranded RNA molecules that regulate target gene expression via post-transcriptional modifications [Mohr A. M&amp; Mott J. L 2015 and Lai&nbsp;E. C. 2002). Several studies indicated the promising role of miRNA in the diagnosis and outcome prediction in several cancers (Mirzaei H&nbsp;et al 2018 and Liu, S. Y&nbsp;et al 2017). miRNA-21 is upregulated and promotes metastasis in several cancers (Kunita, A&nbsp;et al 2018 and&nbsp;Liu Z&nbsp;et al 2015). A Chinese study by Kunita et al proved that plasma levels of miRNA&nbsp;were up-regulated in large B-cell lymphoma patients (Kunita, A&nbsp;et al 2018). A study&nbsp;by Wang et al also proved that plasma levels of miR&nbsp;were upregulated in large B-cell lymphoma patients in China (Chen et al 2014). Although miR-21 was indicated to play a crucial role in the metastasis of lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and head and neck cancer through several signaling pathways, the molecular mechanism of how miR-21 regulates the EMT process in breast cancer is not clear (Liu S. Y&nbsp;et al, Lopez-Santillan&nbsp;et al 2018, Panagal M.&nbsp;et al 2018, Zhou, B.et al 2018, Brabletz T&nbsp;et al and Ye, X.&nbsp;et al 2017).There are a number of miRNAs which regulate SIRT 1 expression.&nbsp;The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process that which epithelial cells lose their cell polarity and cell adhesion ability, which will lead to cancer metastasis (Vaziri H&nbsp;et al 2001 and Luo, J&nbsp;et al 2001). Epithelial cells exhibit the property of regular cell-cell contacts, adhesion to the surrounding cellular fabric, preventing the detachment of individual cells. Whereas mesenchymal cells do not form intercellular contacts.&nbsp;   Sirtuins are nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)&ndash;dependent deacetylases that function as intracellular regulators of transcriptional activity (Blander G &amp; Guarente L 2004&nbsp;and Roth M &amp; Chen W 2014). It plays important roles in cell survival, signal transduction, and cell apoptosis by deacetylating key cell signaling molecules and apoptotic related proteins, such as NF-kB, p53, Ku70, and HIFs (Zhao, W&nbsp;et al 2008 and Chen W &amp; Bhatia R&nbsp;2013). Various studies have inconclusive reports&nbsp;on the role of SIRT1 in cancer, because of its opposite effects as both a tumor activator or suppressor in various human cancers, including breast cancer.&nbsp; Deng et al found that the expression of SIRT1 was lower in prostate cancer, bladder cancer, ovarian cancer, and glioblastoma when compared with normal tissues (Han, L&nbsp;et al 2013).On the contrary, it was found that, in leukemia and lung cancer, SIRT1 was significantly higher(Riggio M&nbsp;et al 2012 and Lee M S&nbsp;et al 2015).   This can be explained as follows: SIRT1-mediated deacetylation suppresses the functions of several tumor suppressors including p53, p73, and HIC1, it has been suggested that SIRT1 has a promoting function in tumor development and progression [Pinton G&nbsp;et al 2016, Pillai VB&nbsp;&nbsp;et al 2014, Wan G&nbsp;et al 2017 and Hwang B&nbsp;et al 2014].&nbsp;In contrast, SIRT1 may have a suppressive activity in tumor cell growth by suppressing NF-&kappa;B,&nbsp;a transcription factor playing a central role in the regulation of the innate and adaptive immune responses and carcinogenesis, the dysregulation of which leads to the onset of tumorigenesis and tumor malignancy(Yuan J&nbsp;et al 2009, Wang R H&nbsp;et al 2008, Chen L F&nbsp;et al 2004 and Greten F R &amp; Karin M 2004).&nbsp;Here, we aim to further explore the role of the SIRT1-NF kB signaling pathway in tumorigenesis&nbsp;of the breast as well as its associated mechanisms.  The nuclear factor-&kappa;B (NF- &kappa;B)/REL family of transcription factors is comprised of a RELA/p65,c-REL, RELB, p105/NF- &kappa;B1 and p100/NF- &kappa;B2 (Van Laere S J&nbsp;et al 2007). The p105 and p100 proteins can be processed by proteolytic cleavage into p50 and p52, respectively. Activation of the NF-&kappa;B signaling pathway leads to the induction of target genes that can inhibit apoptosis, interaction with cell cycle regulation, cell invasion, contribute to tumorigenesis and metastatic invasion (Shostak K &amp; Chariot 2011). Activation NF-&kappa;B in breast cancer is loss of Estrogen Receptor (ER) expression and Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER-2) overexpressed via epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway (Ali S &amp; Coombes R C&nbsp;2002). Indeed, the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) to its receptor (EGFR) also ultimately activates NF-&kappa;B and most likely contributes to the enhanced activity of this transcription factor in ER-negative breast cancer cells (Kalkhoven E&nbsp;et al 1996).   Loss of ER function has been associated with constitutive NFkB activity and hyperactive MAPK, because of constitutive secretion of cytokine and growth factors, which ultimately culminates in aggressive, metastatic, hormone-resistant cancers (Merkhofer E C&nbsp;et al 2010). Activation of the progesterone receptor can lead to inhibition of NF-&kappa;B driven gene expression (Sethi G&nbsp;et al 2008)&nbsp;reducing its DNA binding and transcriptional activity. HER-2 activates NF-&kappa;B through the canonical pathway which surprisingly, involves IKK&alpha; (Ito, T&nbsp;et al 2010). Activation of NF-&kappa;B promotes the survival of tumor cells. Several gene products that negatively regulate apoptosis in tumor cells are controlled by NF-&kappa;B activation (Lee J&nbsp;et al 2010). Estrogen plays an important role in breast cancer initiation and progression. Breast cancer over time acquires different mutations and the proportion of estrogen receptor-negative cells in tumors increases. This transformation confers aggressive biological characteristics to breast cancer such as rapid growth, poor differentiation, and poor response to hormone therapy. NF-&kappa;B pathway plays important role in this pathway (Lee J&nbsp;et al 2010).   Expression of SIRT1 is controlled at multiple levels by transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and post-translational mechanisms under physiological and pathological conditions. Emerging evidence indicates that miRs are important regulators of SIRT1 expression (Lovis P&nbsp;et al 2008,&nbsp;Ortega F J&nbsp;et al 2010, Zovoilis A&nbsp;et al 2011, Yamakuchi M&nbsp;et al 2008 and Mullany L E&nbsp;et al 2017). Studies have shown that miR-34a directly binds to the 3&prime; untranslated region (UTR) of SIRT1 mRNA and reduces its expression (Ortega F J&nbsp;et al 2010).   Study findings support the hypothesis that alcohol consumption is able to influence miRNA expression.&nbsp;Considerable evidence from rodent and human studies demonstrates that disruption of the hepatic SIRT1 signaling by ethanol plays a central role in the development of AFLD (Yin H&nbsp;et al 2014, Li M&nbsp;et al 2014).Ethanol down-regulates SIRT1 in hepatic cells and in the animal livers. The ethanol-mediated disruption of SIRT1 signaling leads to excess fat accumulation and inflammatory responses in the liver of animals and humans. Treatment with resveratrol, a known SIRT1 agonist, can alleviate liver steatosis . Accumulating evidence demonstrates that ethanol-mediated SIRT1 inhibition leads to the development of AFLD largely through disruption of a signaling network mediated by various transcriptional regulators and co-regulators, including nuclear transcription factor-&kappa;B (NF-&kappa;B)(Yin H&nbsp;et al 2014, Li M&nbsp;et al 2014)."@en ;

  dc:description "The Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) holds substantial regulatory significance as a structured framework for understanding and predicting the biological sequence of events leading from DNA damage&nbsp;to a metastatic breast cancer. By elucidating the causal relationships between key events along the pathway, AOP&nbsp;offer a comprehensive understanding of toxicological mechanisms and provide a basis for informed decision-making in risk assessment and regulatory decision-making. AOPs facilitate the integration of diverse scientific data, enabling regulators to evaluate the potential impact of chemical exposures on human health and the environment. These pathways empower the development of targeted testing strategies, alternative methods, and safer chemical design, ultimately enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of risk assessment and regulatory policies.  Metastasis, the process by which cancer cells spread from the primary tumor to distant sites in the body, holds significant regulatory importance in cancer biology and beyond. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms underlying metastasis is crucial for developing effective therapeutic strategies and improving patient outcomes. Here are some key aspects of its regulatory significance:  1. Therapeutic Target Identification: Regulatory pathways governing metastasis represent potential targets for therapeutic intervention. By elucidating the signaling networks and molecular drivers involved in metastatic processes such as cell migration, invasion, and angiogenesis, researchers can identify druggable targets for the development of anti-metastatic therapies. Targeting these pathways can potentially inhibit the spread of cancer cells and prevent the formation of secondary tumors, thereby improving patient survival and quality of life.  2. Biomarker Discovery: Metastasis-specific biomarkers have diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications. Regulatory molecules or genetic signatures associated with metastatic potential can serve as biomarkers for predicting patient outcomes, stratifying patients for personalized treatment approaches, and monitoring disease progression. Biomarker discovery efforts aim to identify molecular signatures indicative of metastatic propensity, enabling early detection of metastasis and guiding treatment decisions.  3. Therapeutic Resistance Mechanisms: Metastatic tumors often exhibit resistance to conventional therapies, posing a significant clinical challenge. Regulatory mechanisms underlying therapy resistance in metastatic cancer cells, such as alterations in drug efflux pumps, DNA repair pathways, and apoptotic signaling, need to be elucidated. Understanding these resistance mechanisms can inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies to overcome drug resistance and improve treatment efficacy in metastatic cancer patients.  4. Microenvironment Modulation: The tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in regulating metastasis by providing a supportive niche for cancer cell survival, proliferation, and dissemination. Regulatory factors within the tumor microenvironment, including stromal cells, immune cells, extracellular matrix components, and signaling molecules, influence metastatic progression. Targeting the tumor microenvironment to disrupt pro-metastatic signaling pathways or enhance anti-tumor immune responses represents a promising therapeutic approach to inhibit metastasis and improve treatment outcomes.  5. Epigenetic Regulation: Epigenetic alterations, such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA dysregulation, contribute to metastatic phenotypes by modulating gene expression programs associated with cell motility, invasion, and metastatic colonization. Understanding the epigenetic regulatory mechanisms driving metastasis can provide insights into novel therapeutic targets and strategies for epigenetic therapy in metastatic cancer.  In summary, metastasis exerts significant regulatory influence on cancer progression and treatment response. Elucidating the molecular and cellular regulatory mechanisms governing metastasis is essential for the development of targeted therapies, biomarker-driven treatment strategies, and interventions to overcome therapeutic resistance. By targeting metastasis-specific pathways and processes, researchers aim to improve patient outcomes and ultimately reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with metastatic cancer."@en ;

  dc:description "It is well documented that ionizing radiation( (eg.&nbsp;X-rays, gamma, photons, alpha, beta, neutrons, heavy ions)&nbsp;leads to energy deposition on the atoms and molecules of the substrate. Many studies, have demonstrated that the type of radiation and distance from source has an impact on the pattern of energy deposition (Alloni, et al. 2014). High linear energy transfer (LET) radiation has been associated with higher-energy deposits (Liamsuwan et al., 2014) that are more densely-packed and cause more complex effects within the particle track (Hada and Georgakilas, 2008; Okayasu, 2012ab; Lorat et al., 2015; Nikitaki et al., 2016) in comparison to low LET radiation. Parameters such as mean lineal energy, dose mean lineal energy, frequency mean specific energy and dose mean specific energy can impact track structure of the traversed energy into a medium (Friedland et al., 2017). The detection of energy deposition by ionizing radiation can be demonstrated with the use of fluorescent nuclear track detectors (FNTDs). FNTDs used in conjunction with fluorescent microscopy, are able to visualize radiation tracks produced by ionizing radiation (Niklas et al., 2013; Kodaira et al., 2015; Sawakuchi and Akselrod, 2016). In addition, these FNTD chips can quantify the LET of primary and secondary radiation tracks up to 0.47 keV/um (Sawakuchi and Akselrod, 2016). This co-visualization of the radiation tracks and the cell markers enable the mapping of the radiation trajectory to specific cellular compartments, and the identification of accrued damage (Niklas et al., 2013; Kodaira et al., 2015). There are no known chemical initiators or prototypes that can mimic the MIE."@en ;

  dc:description "Lung cancer, one of the most common and deadly forms of cancer, is in some cases associated with exposure to certain types of particles. With the rise of nanotechnology, there is concern that some engineered nanoparticles may be among such particles. In the absence of epidemiological evidence, assessment of nanoparticle carcinogenicity is currently performed on a time-consuming case-by-case basis, relying mainly on animal experiments. Non-animal alternatives exist, including a few validated cell-based methods accepted for regulatory risk assessment of nanoparticles. Furthermore, new approach methodologies (NAMs), focused on carcinogenic mechanisms and capable of handling the increasing numbers of nanoparticles, have been developed. However, such alternative methods are mainly applied as weight-of-evidence linked to generally required animal data, since challenges remain regarding interpretation of the results. These challenges may be more easily overcome by the novel Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) framework, which provides a basis for validation and uptake of alternative mechanism-focused methods in risk assessment. Here, we propose an AOP for lung cancer induced by nanosized foreign matter, anchored to a selection of 18 standardized methods and NAMs for&nbsp;in silico- and&nbsp;in vitro-based integrated assessment of lung carcinogenicity (Figure 1). The AOP&nbsp;provides a basis for development of AOP-aligned alternative methods-based integrated testing strategies for assessment of nanoparticle-induced lung cancer.  &nbsp;    Figure 1.

  dc:description "As stated earlier, there are many different ways by which pro-fibrotic stressors can interact with the components of cell membrane and often involve multiple interactions at the same time. Few studies investigate the exact interaction between the stressor and the cellular membrane components. Asbestos and silica crystals engage scavenger receptors present on the macrophages (Murthy et al., 2015). Bleomycin binds high affinity bleomycin binding sites present on rat alveolar macrophage surfaces, leading to macrophage activation (Denholm and Phan, 1990). However, the consequences of such interactions such as, the release of PRR agonists DAMPs (alarmins) from dying or injured cells, increased&nbsp; gene or protein synthesis downstream of receptor binding or in the case of NMs, their cellular uptake, are measured routinely as indicative of occurrence of such interactions (Nel et al., 2009; Cheng et al., 2013). Because of the phys-chem properties such as surface charge, NMs and asbestos like materials can bind to cellular macromolecules and cell surface/membrane components, which in turn, facilitate their uptake and intracellular sequestration by the cells (NIOSH, 2011a; Pascolo et al., 2013). Several DAMPs that can be effectively measured in biological samples and cultured cells include High Mobility Group Binding 1 (HMGB1) protein, Heat Shock proteins (HSPs), uric acid, annexins, and S100 proteins (Bianchi, 2007). Of all DAMPs, interleukin (IL)-1&alpha; is the most commonly measured alarmin. IL-1&alpha; is the principal pro-inflammatory moiety and is a designated &lsquo;alarmin&rsquo; in the cell that alerts the host to injury or damage (Di Paolo and Shayakhmetov, 2016). It is shown that administration of necrotic cells to mice results in neutrophilic inflammation that was entirely mediated by IL-1&alpha; released from the dying or necrosed cells and consequent activation of IL-1 Receptor 1 (IL-1R1) signalling (Suwara et al., 2014). IL-1&alpha; is released following exposure to MWCNTs (Nikota et al., 2017) and silica (Rabolli et al., 2014). Although IL1-b is not a designated alarmin, its secretion following exposure to stressors is routinely assessed and is linked to initiation of cell or tissue injury.  Other high aspect ratio fibres such as asbestos and CNTs induce frustrated phagocytosis and acute cell injury (Boyles et al., 2015; D&ouml;rger et al., 2001; Brown et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2010; Poland et al., 2008), leading to DAMP release (Nikota et al, 2017), inflammation and immune responses."@en ;

  dc:description "The AHR can be activated by several structurally diverse chemicals, but binds preferentially to planar halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Dioxin-like compounds (DLCs), which include polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and certain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), are among the most potent AHR ligands[38]. Only a subset of PCDD, PCDF and PCB congeners has been shown to bind to the AHR and cause toxic effects to those elicited by TCDD. Until recently, TCDD was considered to be the most potent DLC in birds[39]; however, recent reports indicate that 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (PeCDF) is more potent than TCDD in some species of birds.[40][13][41][21][42][43] When screened for their ability to induce aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) activity, dioxins with chlorine atoms at a minimum of three out of the four lateral ring positions, and with at least one non-chlorinated ring position are the most active[44]. Of the dioxin-like PCBs, non-ortho congeners are the most toxicologically active, while mono-ortho PCBs are generally less potent[45][9]. Chlorine substitution at ortho positions increases the energetic costs of assuming the coplanar conformation required for binding to the AHR [45]. Thus, a smaller proportion of mono-ortho PCB molecules are able to bind to the AHR and elicit toxic effects, resulting in reduced potency of these congeners. Other PCB congeners, such as di-ortho substituted PCBs, are very weak AHR agonists and do not likely contribute to dioxin-like effects [9].   	Contrary to studies of birds and mammals, even the most potent mono-ortho PCBs bind to AhRs of fishes with very low affinity, if at all (Abnet et al 1999; Doering et al 2014; 2015; Eisner et al 2016; Van den Berg et al 1998).   The role of the AHR in mediating the toxic effects of planar hydrophobic contaminants has been well studied, however the endogenous role of the AHR is less clear [1]. Some endogenous and natural substances, including prostaglandin PGG2 and the tryptophan derivatives indole-3-carbinol, 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ) and kynurenic acid can bind to and activate the AHR. [6][46][47][48][49] The AHR is thought to have important endogenous roles in reproduction, liver and heart development, cardiovascular function, immune function and cell cycle regulation [50][38][51][52][53][54][46][55][56][57] and activation of the AHR by DLCs may therefore adversely affect these processes."@en ;

  dc:description "&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;The key events (KEs) associated with AOPs 455 and 456 are predominantly similar, with the exception of KE4 in each AOP. KE4 in AOP 455 is designated an AO and is Event 1559: &ldquo;Facial cartilage structures are reduced in size and morphologically distorted&rdquo;, and KE4 in AOP 456 is Event 317: &ldquo;Altered, Cardiovascular development/function.&rdquo; While AOP 456 may be of higher biologically relevance, both AOPs are ecologically important and contribute significantly to the growing network of AOPs beginning with the activation of the Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr). Since both AOPs have several overlapping KEs, some redundant text is to be expected in the individual AOP-Wiki pages.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  The Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (Ahrs) are evolutionarily conserved ligand-dependent transcription factors that can be activated by a wide range of structurally diverse compounds (Denison and Nagy 2003; Hahn et al. 2017). The Ahrs have critical physiological roles in normal development of both vertebrates and invertebrates, and several endogenous Ahr ligands, such as retinoic acid and metabolites of tryptophan, have been identified (Esteban et al. 2021; Nguyen and Bradfield 2008). In addition, Ahr activation by environmental pollutants including halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (HAHs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) can lead to a variety of adverse health effects, such as dysfunction to the immune, reproductive, and cardiovascular systems (Hansen et al. 2014; Hernandez-Ochoa et al. 2009; Stevens et al. 2009; Zhang 2011), as well as improper development and neurobehavior (Garcia et al. 2018a). Ahr activation is also associated with tumor promotion and carcinogenesis (Safe et al. 2013). Several studies in model organisms such as zebrafish and rodents have shown that Ahr-deficient animals in gene knock-out studies have either diminished or no harmful effects from exposure to Ahr activating environmental pollutants (Fernandez-Salguero et al. 1996; Garcia et al. 2018a; Goodale et al. 2015; Harrill et al. 2016), highlighting the significance of the receptors in mediating toxicity of Ahr-active chemicals.  2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a bioaccumulative and highly toxic HAH, is typically used as the prototypical molecular probe to investigate Ahr-related outcomes and is thus one of the most thoroughly investigated of the known Ahr agonists. One notable difference between dioxins such as TCDD, and labile PAHs for example, is that TCDD exposure leads to prolonged and continuous receptor activation, which is different from PAH-induced transient receptor activation that is generally considered an adaptive response. However, significant dioxin-like toxicity, including generation of oxidative stress, has been demonstrated in several organisms exposed to PAHs. Toxicity is generally attributed to the generation of harmful reactive metabolites, or from environmentally relevant chronic PAH exposures that can induce sustained Ahr activation (Billiard et al. 1999). Further, any differences in Ahr-dependent toxicity among species is likely because of the presence of multiple Ahr isoforms, in combination with their differential binding affinities to a specific chemical (Doering et al. 2013; Doering et al. 2018; Karchner et al. 2006). Regardless, it is widely accepted that upon activation of the Ahrs, a cascade of complex molecular events ensues, leading to crosstalk signaling and pathophysiological effects. While several possible lesser-understood signaling pathways exist (Sondermann et al. 2023; Wright et al. 2017), the most widely described and major signaling route is the canonical Ahr signaling pathway.   Canonical Ahr signaling involves the conversion of the inactive Ahr, which is present in the cytoplasm, to its active form that can translocate to the nucleus and dimerize with the Ahr nuclear translocator (ARNT) (Wright et al. 2017). The Ahr-ARNT heterodimer can consequently regulate transcription of several downstream genes either indirectly, or directly, which is the case for the cytochrome P450s (CYPs) that are induced via the direct binding of the heterodimer to the aryl hydrocarbon response elements (Ahres, or XREs or DREs) (Lo and Matthews 2012). To help organize the complexity of the concurrent regulation of 1000s of genes by the Ahr signaling pathway, as well as consequent toxicity effects, scientists have begun to organize existing evidence in the form of Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs) (Ankley et al. 2010) and AOP networks (Knapen et al. 2018). There are currently nineteen Ahr-related AOPs in the AOP-Wiki (as of April 10th, 2023; aopwiki.org), with six AOPs included in The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development&rsquo;s (OECD) Work Plan that are open for comments, and the remaining 13 relatively under developed. With the rapid rate at which new research on Ahr-mediated toxicity is being conducted, there is still extensive scope for assembly of existing and novel biological data into actionable knowledge that can support decision-making around Ahr-related environmental effects and disease outcomes.   Besides being highly relevant and important toxicity phenotypes in both humans and other vertebrates, both craniofacial malformations and cardiovascular toxicity are easily observable and measurable in zebrafish, and have been identified upon exposure to various Ahr activating environmental chemicals (Antkiewicz et al. 2005; Henry et al. 1997; Li et al. 2014). Importantly, developing zebrafish exposed to TCDD have severe heart and vasculature malformations, in addition to jaw structure impairments that occur secondarily to inhibited chondrogenesis (Carney et al. 2006). One of the genes whose expression is most reduced in the jaw upon TCDD exposure in zebrafish is sox9b, sry-box containing gene 9b (Xiong et al. 2008). This gene, one of two zebrafish paralogs of the SOX9 gene, is a critical transcription factor that has been implicated in several processes including chondrogenesis and cardiac development, in addition to skeletal development, male gonad genesis, and cancer progression (Lefebvre and Dvir-Ginzberg 2017; Panda et al. 2021). Based on current knowledge, primarily from developmental zebrafish studies, it is apparent that there are strong relationships between Ahr, SOX9, and craniofacial (AOP 455) or cardiovascular (AOP 456) malformations that can be causally linked in an AOP network.   The two AOPs also provide weight of evidence for the inclusion of a novel long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) as a key event. LncRNAs are transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that do not encode functional proteins, but have their own promoters and the ability to be processed (spliced and polyadenylated) similar to mRNAs (Mattick et al. 2023). The nature of lncRNAs is such that they have diverse functions and can regulate gene expression at multiple levels, including by interacting with DNA, RNA, proteins, and altering transcription of both neighboring and distant genes (Statello et al. 2021). Importantly, there is growing recognition for the link between exposure to chemicals, differential expression profiles of lncRNAs, and consequent toxicity (Dempsey and Cui 2017). Specific to the proposed AOPs, evidence suggests an important role for the recently discovered lncRNA, &ldquo;sox9b long intergenic non-coding RNA&rdquo; (slincR) in the Ahr signaling toxicity pathway via its interaction with the transcription factor, SOX9 (Garcia et al. 2017). Thus, the ability of SOX9 to interact with Ahr signaling, paired with its functional versatility, implicates it as a critical player in the Ahr toxicity pathway, by mediating disruptions to both craniofacial and cardiovascular development."@en ;

Canonical Ahr signaling involves the conversion of the inactive Ahr, which is present in the cytoplasm, to its active form that can translocate to the nucleus and dimerize with the Ahr nuclear translocator (ARNT) (Wright et al. 2017). The Ahr-ARNT heterodimer can consequently regulate transcription of several downstream genes either indirectly, or directly, which is the case for the cytochrome P450s (CYPs) that are induced via the direct binding of the heterodimer to the aryl hydrocarbon response elements (Ahres, or XREs or DREs) (Lo and Matthews 2012). To help organize the complexity of the concurrent regulation of 1000s of genes by the Ahr signaling pathway, as well as consequent toxicity effects, scientists have begun to organize existing evidence in the form of Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs) (Ankley et al. 2010) and AOP networks (Knapen et al. 2018). There are currently nineteen Ahr-related AOPs in the AOP-Wiki (as of April 10th, 2023; aopwiki.org), with six AOPs included in The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development&rsquo;s (OECD) Work Plan that are open for comments, and the remaining 13 relatively under developed. With the rapid rate at which new research on Ahr-mediated toxicity is being conducted, there is still extensive scope for assembly of existing and novel biological data into actionable knowledge that can support decision-making around Ahr-related environmental effects and disease outcomes.   Besides being highly relevant and important toxicity phenotypes in both humans and other vertebrates, both craniofacial malformations and cardiovascular toxicity are easily observable and measurable in zebrafish, and have been identified upon exposure to various Ahr activating environmental chemicals (Antkiewicz et al. 2005; Henry et al. 1997; Li et al. 2014). Importantly, developing zebrafish exposed to TCDD have severe heart and vasculature malformations, in addition to jaw structure impairments that occur secondarily to inhibited chondrogenesis (Carney et al. 2006). One of the genes whose expression is most reduced in the jaw upon TCDD exposure in zebrafish is sox9b, sry-box containing gene 9b (Xiong et al. 2008). This gene, one of two zebrafish paralogs of the SOX9 gene, is a critical transcription factor that has been implicated in several processes including chondrogenesis and cardiac development, in addition to skeletal development, male gonad genesis, and cancer progression (Lefebvre and Dvir-Ginzberg 2017; Panda et al. 2021). Based on current knowledge, primarily from developmental zebrafish studies, it is apparent that there are strong relationships between Ahr, SOX9, and craniofacial (AOP 455) or cardiovascular (AOP 456) malformations that can be causally linked in an AOP network.   The two AOPs also provide weight of evidence for the inclusion of a novel long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) as a key event. LncRNAs are transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that do not encode functional proteins, but have their own promoters and the ability to be processed (spliced and polyadenylated) similar to mRNAs (Mattick et al. 2023). The nature of lncRNAs is such that they have diverse functions and can regulate gene expression at multiple levels, including by interacting with DNA, RNA, proteins, and altering transcription of both neighboring and distant genes (Statello et al. 2021). Importantly, there is growing recognition for the link between exposure to chemicals, differential expression profiles of lncRNAs, and consequent toxicity (Dempsey and Cui 2017). Specific to the proposed AOPs, evidence suggests an important role for the recently discovered lncRNA, &ldquo;sox9b long intergenic non-coding RNA&rdquo; (slincR) in the Ahr signaling toxicity pathway via its interaction with the transcription factor, SOX9 (Garcia et al. 2017). Thus, the ability of SOX9 to interact with Ahr signaling, paired with its functional versatility, implicates it as a critical player in the Ahr toxicity pathway, by mediating disruptions to both craniofacial and cardiovascular development."@en ;

  dc:description "This AOP was created in order to collate information, and attempt to drive understanding, around several key issues concerning xenobiotic driven disruption of energy metabolism, and the subsequent development of related pathologies. Specifically, the focus is on the nature and extent of the component of this disruption that can potentially be mediated via alteration of thyroid gland function, and consequent changes in circulating thyroid hormone concentrations (Huang et al, 2021).  Amongst classes of xenobiotics, fragmentary evidence indicates that this is one possible route - amongst many - by which toxicity of phthalate esters could manifest itself. This evidence includes the observations that :   	Phthalate esters can increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentrations in multiple in vitro systems and in vivo (see, for example, Mondal and Bandypoadhayay, 2023). 	Phthalate esters can decrease concentrations of thyroid hormones in vivo (Kim et al, 2019). 	Phthalate ester exposure has been correlated to pathologies of energy metabolism, such as insulin resistance (Shoshtari-Yeganeh et al, 2019; Gao et al, 2021). 	Decrease in circulating thyroid hormones has been linked to the development of insulin resistance (Brenta, 2011).   Given the role of thyroid hormones in regulating energy metabolism, including glucose and lipids, the possibility exists for phthalate-induced disruptions in energy metabolism and contribution to subsequent pathologies to be mediated at least, in part, through their impacts on thyroid function.

  dc:description "The AHR can be activated by several structurally diverse chemicals, but binds preferentially to planar halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Dioxin-like compounds (DLCs), which include polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and certain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), are among the most potent AHR ligands[38]. Only a subset of PCDD, PCDF and PCB congeners has been shown to bind to the AHR and cause toxic effects to those elicited by TCDD. Until recently, TCDD was considered to be the most potent DLC in birds[39]; however, recent reports indicate that 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (PeCDF) is more potent than TCDD in some species of birds.[40][13][41][21][42][43] When screened for their ability to induce aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) activity, dioxins with chlorine atoms at a minimum of three out of the four lateral ring positions, and with at least one non-chlorinated ring position are the most active[44]. Of the dioxin-like PCBs, non-ortho congeners are the most toxicologically active, while mono-ortho PCBs are generally less potent[45][9]. Chlorine substitution at ortho positions increases the energetic costs of assuming the coplanar conformation required for binding to the AHR [45]. Thus, a smaller proportion of mono-ortho PCB molecules are able to bind to the AHR and elicit toxic effects, resulting in reduced potency of these congeners. Other PCB congeners, such as di-ortho substituted PCBs, are very weak AHR agonists and do not likely contribute to dioxin-like effects [9].   	Contrary to studies of birds and mammals, even the most potent mono-ortho PCBs bind to AhRs of fishes with very low affinity, if at all (Abnet et al 1999; Doering et al 2014; 2015; Eisner et al 2016; Van den Berg et al 1998).   The role of the AHR in mediating the toxic effects of planar hydrophobic contaminants has been well studied, however the endogenous role of the AHR is less clear [1]. Some endogenous and natural substances, including prostaglandin PGG2 and the tryptophan derivatives indole-3-carbinol, 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ) and kynurenic acid can bind to and activate the AHR. [6][46][47][48][49] The AHR is thought to have important endogenous roles in reproduction, liver and heart development, cardiovascular function, immune function and cell cycle regulation [50][38][51][52][53][54][46][55][56][57] and activation of the AHR by DLCs may therefore adversely affect these processes."@en ;

The U.S. EPA Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS database) contains 111 instances wherein HCC has been considered in hazard assessment of environmental contaminants.  For example, HCC in rats formed part of the weight of evidence in categorizing polychlorinated biphenyls as probable human carcinogens. These tumors, combined with other liver tumors, also formed the basis for quantitative dose-response assessment for cancer induced by polychlorinated biphenyls by the oral route.(USEPA, 2014).

  dc:description "This AOP describes a mutagenic mode of action (MOA) for cancer, using Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) as a case example. Mutagenic MOAs are distinguished from other MOAs for cancer in that the chemical induces mutations in genes that are involved in the etiology of the cancer. This MOA is distinguished from a non-mutagenic MOA for carcinogens that cause proliferation of cells with existing mutations, or that in some other way promote the growth of cancer gene mutant cells. The induction of mutation in the cancer critical gene is the key event (KE) that is unique to mutagenic MOA (Jarabek et al., 2009; Pottenger et al., 2014). In this AFB1 case example, mutation in critical genes is a consequence of formation of pro-mutagenic DNA adducts by metabolites of the chemical. It is important to note that all cancers involve an increase in cells containing mutations in cancer critical gene(s). Likewise, cell proliferation is an essential step in the formation of tumors. To establish that an agent has a mutagenic MOA, it is necessary to determine the key events, both in terms of temporality and of dose-response concordance, between the increase in the number of mutant cells, cell proliferation, the appearance of any pre-neoplastic lesions, and ultimately tumor occurrence. The types of data that can be used to investigate whether a chemical acts via a mutagenic MOA include information on the chemical&rsquo;s ability to cause mutations, the temporality of those induced mutations, and the type of mutations that the chemical induces. It is not sufficient to determine if the chemical can induce mutations in any one of a number of standard gene mutation assays. Furthermore, because the etiology of all tumors includes an increase in cells with cancer gene mutations, the presence of mutations in the tumor tissue does not provide definitive information on MOA. When there is a high frequency of tumors with specific mutations (as is the case for AFB1), this observation provides a hypothesis that can be further evaluated.  The most definitive level of proof that a chemical acts via a mutagenic MOA is the demonstration that the chemical can induce the specific cancer gene mutation(s) observed in a majority of the specific tumors, and that the formation of this mutation is an early KE in the AOP (Moore et al., 2008). In the absence of this information, the ability of the chemical to induce the type(s) of mutations seen in the majority of the specific tumors adds greatly to the weight of evidence. Such information on specific chemical-induced mutations in cancer critical genes is uncommon, and currently, no such information is available for AFB1. A newly developed method, allele specific competitive blocker-polymerase chain reaction (ACB-PCR) has proved useful in providing such information, and data on specific chemical-induced mutations are available for only a very small number of chemicals (Parsons et al., 2010).  Both in vitro and in vivo gene mutation assays can detect chemically induced mutations; by sequencing the DNA from mutants induced in these assays, the type(s) of mutations that a chemical induces can be determined. A match between the type(s) of mutations found in these surrogate gene mutation assays and the mutations seen in a majority of the tumors provides a high level of confidence that the chemical has a mutagenic MOA for the induction of those specific tumors. Fortunately this type of data is available for AFB1.  This AOP is written for AFB1, a data-rich chemical. It is clear that (1) AFB1 can induce mutations in gene mutation assays; (2) AFB1 induces hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in a variety of species, including humans; (3) there is a high frequency of a specific cancer gene mutation (codon 249 of p53) in the human HCCs found in people in regions with high AFB1 exposure; and (4) the type of mutation seen in the human tumor (codon 249 of p53) is the same type of mutation that is seen in the surrogate gene mutation assay. Thus there is a high level of confidence that AFB1 has a mutagenic MOA for HCC in humans.  The AOP for a mutagenic MOA for liver cancer induced by Aflatoxin B1 includes the following series of key events: &bull; pre-MIE: Hepatic metabolic activation &bull; MIE: Pro-mutagenic DNA adduct formation &bull; KE#1: Insufficient repair or mis-repair of pro-mutagenic DNA adducts &bull; KE#2: Induced mutation in critical genes &bull; KE#3: Cellular proliferation and clonal expansion of mutant cells (pre-neoplastic lesions) &bull; AO: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)  This AOP describes the KE that are specific to a mutagenic MOA for AFB1 (e.g., [pre-Molecular Initiating Event or pre-MIE: metabolic activation,] MIE: pro-mutagenic AFB1 DNA adduct, KE#1: insufficient/mis-repair of DNA, KE#2: induced mutation in critical gene). In addition, this AOP includes all of the steps involved from the exposure to AFB1 through to the appearance of the HCC, the adverse outcome. KE#3, the occurrence and growth of altered hepatic foci and the subsequent development of HCC (as described below) are events that would be involved in the etiology of all HCC whether occurring through a mutagenic MOA or another, different MOA. Although AFB1-specific information is lacking for these later steps in the AOP, the accumulated scientific knowledge of the development of HCC includes the recognition that all AOPs leading to HCC have a number of general steps in common; thus, these general steps are included in this AOP and are identified as not being specific to AFB1-induced HCC."@en ;

  dc:description "Neurotoxic effects shall be carefully addressed and reported in routine required regulatory toxicological studies (acute toxicity studies,short-term toxicity studies, long term toxicity and carcinogenicity studies and reproductive toxicity studies). Regarding neurotoxicity in rodents, inclusion of neurotoxicity investigations in routine toxicology studies shall also be considered. For pesticide active substances the circumstances in which neurotoxicity studies should be performed are listed in Regulation (EU) No 283/2013:  Specific neurotoxicity studies in rodents shall be performed in case of one those following conditions:   	there is indication of neurotoxicity in routine toxicity studies carried out with the active substance; 	the active substance is a structurally related to known neurotoxic compound; 	the active substance has a neurotoxic mode of pesticidal action.   As a result, specific neurotoxicity studies are not routinely required for all pesticide active substances. Specific neurotoxicity testing becomes obligatory only if neurotoxicity has been observed during histopathological evaluation or in case of structural analogy with a known neurotoxic compound. Motor activity should be measured once in short-term repeated dose toxicity studies (OECD 407, 408 and 422) and several times in specific neurotoxicity studies (OECD 424, OECD 426 and cohort 2 of OECD 443). However, this is not a requirement in chronic toxicity studies unless neurotoxic effects have been reported in the shorter studies. The same test (measures horizontal and/or vertical movements in a test chamber) is implemented in both routine studies and neurotoxicity studies. Coordination and balance are evaluated by rotation or rotarod or pole tests, and gait abnormalities by forepaw stride length test. Those tests are not required by any repeated dose toxicity OECD guidelines and they can be optionally incorporated in the design of neurotoxicity studies OECD 424 and OECD 426.  Although motor deficits is the AO in this AOP, degeneration of DA neurons, is also considered an adverse effect in the regulatory framework, even in the absence of clear clinical symptoms or motor deficits. Morphological assessment of brain structures is a standard requirement in the regulatory toxicological studies supporting the risk assessment of chemical substances and it is a regulatory expectation that the anatomical structures belonging to the nigrostriatal pathway would be included and evaluated as part of the standard evaluation of the brain. Treatment related neuronal degeneration, when occurring as a consequence of the treatment, is generally dose-dependent in incidence and severity. However, if not accompanied by clinical signs or behavioral changes indicative of central nervous system pathology, minimal loss of DA neurons would likely remain undetected in the standard histological evaluation, due to the presence of non DA neurons or as a consequence of the subjectivity of non-quantifiable analysis, unless specific markers are used. As multiple forms of perturbation can affect the neurons, some changes are potentially still reversible (e.g. loss of TH or DA) and irreversibility should be confirmed as part of the assessment. It is then important to apply a sensitive and appropriate method (Switzer 2000) and evaluation of the phenotypic markers in the striatum and in the SNpc should be always performed as a minimum standard (Minnema et al.,&nbsp;2014) when investigating perturbation of the nigrostriatal pathway. It should additionally consider that rat is likely to be a poor model to capture this kind of hazard, as demonstrated by the poor sensitivity of rat to MPTP or related compounds and this should be taken into account for the design and interpretation of the studies.  Dissimilarities of chemical induced animal models to human disease are also important and should be carefully weighted when considering the duration and schedule of the study/treatment. Differently from the human disease, with the MPTP animal model, the damage occurs rapidly, is hardly progressive, is little age-dependent and formation of Lewy bodies is sometime not occurring (Efremova et al., 2015). Therefore, for different animals models, the standard 90 days toxicity study could not match with the chronic and progressive characteristics of the human disease and compensatory changes influencing DA metabolism and turnover and protein catabolism can occur during the treatment period with an impact on the time of onset of the lesion (Ossowska et al., 2005)."@en ;

Many AOPs were developed in the CIAO project, each AOP focusing on a specific element of the SARS-COV-2 virus responses in humans.  This AOP focuses on the acute respiratory distress associated mortality following viral infection of pulmonary cells by SARS-CoV-2 leading to cell death and excessive inflammatory repsonse."@en ;

  dc:description "Receptor recognition is an essential determinant of molecular level in this AOP. ACE2 was reported as an entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2. The viral entry process is mediated by the envelope-embedded surface-located spike (S) glycoprotein.&nbsp; Jun Lan and Walls, A.C et al (Nature 581, 215&ndash;220; Cell 180, 281&ndash;292) demonstrated a critical initial step of infection at the molecular level from the interaction of ACE2 and S protein. ACE2 has shown that receptor binding affinity to S protein is nM range. To elucidate the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and ACE2 at a higher resolution, they also determined the structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RBD&ndash;ACE2 complex using X-ray crystallography. The expression and distribution of the ACE2 in human body may indicate the potential infection of SARS-CoV-2. Through the developed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) technique and single-cell transcriptomes based on the public database, researchers analyzed the ACE2 RNA expression profile at single-cell resolution. High ACE2 expression was identified in type II alveolar cells (Zou, X. et al. Front. Med.2020)  SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the Coronaviridae family, which includes evolutionary related enveloped (+) strand RNA viruses of vertebrates, such as seasonal common coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and CoV-NL63, SARS-CoV (Kim Young Jun et al)   	 		 			 			Human viruses strains 			 			 			Genus 			 			 			Major cell receptor 			 			 			First report 			 			 			Animal reservoir 			 			 			Intermediate host 			 			 			Pathology 			 			 			Diagnostic test 			 			 			Evidence 			 		 		 			 			HCoV-NL63 			 			 			Alphacoronavirus 			 			 			ACE2 			 			 			2004 			 			 			Bat 			 			 			Unknown 			 			 			Mild respiratory tract illness 			 			 			RT-PCR, IF, ELISA, WB 			 			 			Strong 			 		 		 			 			SARS-CoV 			 			 			Betacoronavirus 			 			 			ACE2 			 			 			2003 			 			 			Bat 			 			 			Pangolin 			 			 			Severe acute respiratory syndrome 			 			 			RT-PCR, IF, ELISA, WB 			 			 			Strong 			 		 		 			 			SARS-CoV-2 			 			 			Betacoronavirus 			 			 			ACE2 			 			 			2020 			 			 			Bat 			 			 			Pangolin 			 			 			Severe acute respiratory syndrome 			 			 			RT-PCR, IF, ELISA, WB 			 			 			Strong"@en ;

  dc:description "It is well documented that ionizing radiation( (eg.&nbsp;X-rays, gamma, photons, alpha, beta, neutrons, heavy ions)&nbsp;leads to energy deposition on the atoms and molecules of the substrate. Many studies, have demonstrated that the type of radiation and distance from source has an impact on the pattern of energy deposition (Alloni, et al. 2014). High linear energy transfer (LET) radiation has been associated with higher-energy deposits (Liamsuwan et al., 2014) that are more densely-packed and cause more complex effects within the particle track (Hada and Georgakilas, 2008; Okayasu, 2012ab; Lorat et al., 2015; Nikitaki et al., 2016) in comparison to low LET radiation. Parameters such as mean lineal energy, dose mean lineal energy, frequency mean specific energy and dose mean specific energy can impact track structure of the traversed energy into a medium (Friedland et al., 2017). The detection of energy deposition by ionizing radiation can be demonstrated with the use of fluorescent nuclear track detectors (FNTDs). FNTDs used in conjunction with fluorescent microscopy, are able to visualize radiation tracks produced by ionizing radiation (Niklas et al., 2013; Kodaira et al., 2015; Sawakuchi and Akselrod, 2016). In addition, these FNTD chips can quantify the LET of primary and secondary radiation tracks up to 0.47 keV/um (Sawakuchi and Akselrod, 2016). This co-visualization of the radiation tracks and the cell markers enable the mapping of the radiation trajectory to specific cellular compartments, and the identification of accrued damage (Niklas et al., 2013; Kodaira et al., 2015). There are no known chemical initiators or prototypes that can mimic the MIE."@en ;

  dc:description "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) includes any health condition affecting the heart and blood vessels. CVD is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, accounting for tens of millions of deaths yearly and surpassed in some countries by only cancer (Bray et al., 2021; Tsao et al., 2022). This class of diseases includes congenital defects, as well as CVDs that can develop throughout life such as peripheral artery disease (PAD), atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease and myocardial infarction. While the progression to a CVD outcome can take significant time, many CVDs are often preceded by much earlier changes to vascular structure. Abnormal vascular remodeling entails various structural changes of existing vasculature arising from cell death, cell migration and changes to the endothelial cell membrane. It is important to note that changes to vascular structure are not inherently detrimental, and the cardiovascular system undergoes continuous adaptation to protect vascular health (Pries et al., 2001; Santamar&iacute;a et al., 2020; Zakrzewicz et al., 2002). However, certain remodeling can also serve as an important marker and risk factor for future adverse cardiovascular events (Cohn et al., 2004; Van Varik et al., 2012). Changes to vascular structure can be triggered through various perturbations such oxidative stress, inflammation, and alterations to various cellular signaling pathways. Adverse remodeling of the vasculature encompasses structural and functional changes to vessel wall intima-media, elevated stiffness, and decreased lumen diameter which are all predictive of the development of and mortality and morbidity from CVD (Heald et al., 2006; Hodis et al., 1998; Polak et al., 2011; Zieman et al., 2005).&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  The risk of CVD increases with several factors such as age. There is significant evidence suggesting that environmental factors such as radiation can contribute to the risk of development (Belzile-Dugas &amp; Eisenberg, 2021; Boerma et al., 2016; Francula-Zaninovic &amp; Nola, 2018; Wang et al., 2019). The deposition of energy from radiation exposure is a stochastic event and any part of the human body can be affected, with adverse effects emerging years or decades after the exposure (Boerma et al., 2016; D&ouml;rr, 2015; EPRI, 2020; Menezes et al., 2018). The effects of high-dose radiation on the cardiovascular system have been well-characterized while the effects of low-dose exposure are more contended. However, growing evidence suggests that lower doses than previously thought are linked to subsequent adverse cardiovascular outcomes (Boerma et al., 2016; EPRI, 2020; Little et al., 2021; UNSCEAR, 2008). Much of the high-dose data come from follow up studies in radiotherapy patient cohorts who are shown to be at elevated risk for adverse cardiovascular events (Zou et al., 2019). In addition to clinical exposure scenarios, epidemiological studies of occupational exposures and Japanese atomic bomb survivors have also been conducted. Cohort studies of atomic bomb survivors demonstrate various ways in which CVD risk is affected by exposure parameters, including factors such as age at exposure and estimated dose received (Ozasa et al., 2012; Preston et al., 2003; Shimizu et al., 2010; Takahashi et al., 2017). Long-term follow up of individuals exposed in the Chernobyl disaster region also identified statistically significant elevation in CVD risk (Ivanov et al., 2006; Kashcheev et al., 2017). Occupational exposure studies have also been conducted in various countries in an effort to understand the relationship between low-dose chronic exposure and cardiovascular health of nuclear workers (Azizova et al., 2018; Gillies et al., 2017; Zielinski et al., 2009). Occupational exposure studies suggest positive associations between received dose and excessive relative risk of circulatory diseases (Zielinski et al., 2009), CVD mortality (Gillies et al., 2017) and occurrence of ischemic and cerebrovascular disease involving the blood vessels (Azizova et al., 2018).&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Beyond earth, space travel presents an additional radiation exposure scenario. With future missions planned beyond low Earth orbit and the protective shield of the magnetosphere, understanding the unique challenges of space radiation is crucial for protection of travelers. In space, radiation is present in the form of high linear energy transfer (LET) particles and high mass, high energy ions (HZE) which indiscriminately impacts the whole body at a low fluence rate (Baker et al., 2011; Durante &amp; Cucinotta, 2008; Norbury et al., 2016). While the present AOP includes an MIE focused on deposition of energy following radiation exposure, it is important to note that the space exposome contains multiple stressors to which space travelers will be exposed simultaneously. Particularly important, in the case of the cardiovascular system, is microgravity. The cardiovascular system is gravity sensitive, with the endothelial layer being responsive to changes in shear stress and blood pressure (Hughson et al., 2018; Maier et al., 2015; Versari et al., 2013). Variation to the pressure gradient throughout the body can also trigger regional adaptations to vascular structure (L. F. Zhang, 2013). While determining a mechanism for an MIE of microgravity has proven challenging, microgravity exposure has been shown to contribute to other KEs in the pathway and evidence from microgravity studies has been included in the weight of evidence (WOE).&nbsp;"@en ;

  dc:description "Neurotoxic effects shall be carefully addressed and reported in routine required regulatory toxicological studies (acute toxicity studies,short-term toxicity studies, long term toxicity and carcinogenicity studies and reproductive toxicity studies). Regarding neurotoxicity in rodents, inclusion of neurotoxicity investigations in routine toxicology studies shall also be considered. For pesticide active substances the circumstances in which neurotoxicity studies should be performed are listed in Regulation (EU) No 283/2013:  Specific neurotoxicity studies in rodents shall be performed in case of one those following conditions:   	there is indication of neurotoxicity in routine toxicity studies carried out with the active substance; 	the active substance is a structurally related to known neurotoxic compound; 	the active substance has a neurotoxic mode of pesticidal action.   As a result, specific neurotoxicity studies are not routinely required for all pesticide active substances. Specific neurotoxicity testing becomes obligatory only if neurotoxicity has been observed during histopathological evaluation or in case of structural analogy with a known neurotoxic compound. Motor activity should be measured once in short-term repeated dose toxicity studies (OECD 407, 408 and 422) and several times in specific neurotoxicity studies (OECD 424, OECD 426 and cohort 2 of OECD 443). However, this is not a requirement in chronic toxicity studies unless neurotoxic effects have been reported in the shorter studies. The same test (measures horizontal and/or vertical movements in a test chamber) is implemented in both routine studies and neurotoxicity studies. Coordination and balance are evaluated by rotation or rotarod or pole tests, and gait abnormalities by forepaw stride length test. Those tests are not required by any repeated dose toxicity OECD guidelines and they can be optionally incorporated in the design of neurotoxicity studies OECD 424 and OECD 426.  Although motor deficits is the AO in this AOP, degeneration of DA neurons, is also considered an adverse effect in the regulatory framework, even in the absence of clear clinical symptoms or motor deficits. Morphological assessment of brain structures is a standard requirement in the regulatory toxicological studies supporting the risk assessment of chemical substances and it is a regulatory expectation that the anatomical structures belonging to the nigrostriatal pathway would be included and evaluated as part of the standard evaluation of the brain. Treatment related neuronal degeneration, when occurring as a consequence of the treatment, is generally dose-dependent in incidence and severity. However, if not accompanied by clinical signs or behavioral changes indicative of central nervous system pathology, minimal loss of DA neurons would likely remain undetected in the standard histological evaluation, due to the presence of non DA neurons or as a consequence of the subjectivity of non-quantifiable analysis, unless specific markers are used. As multiple forms of perturbation can affect the neurons, some changes are potentially still reversible (e.g. loss of TH or DA) and irreversibility should be confirmed as part of the assessment. It is then important to apply a sensitive and appropriate method (Switzer 2000) and evaluation of the phenotypic markers in the striatum and in the SNpc should be always performed as a minimum standard (Minnema et al.,&nbsp;2014) when investigating perturbation of the nigrostriatal pathway. It should additionally consider that rat is likely to be a poor model to capture this kind of hazard, as demonstrated by the poor sensitivity of rat to MPTP or related compounds and this should be taken into account for the design and interpretation of the studies.  Dissimilarities of chemical induced animal models to human disease are also important and should be carefully weighted when considering the duration and schedule of the study/treatment. Differently from the human disease, with the MPTP animal model, the damage occurs rapidly, is hardly progressive, is little age-dependent and formation of Lewy bodies is sometime not occurring (Efremova et al., 2015). Therefore, for different animals models, the standard 90 days toxicity study could not match with the chronic and progressive characteristics of the human disease and compensatory changes influencing DA metabolism and turnover and protein catabolism can occur during the treatment period with an impact on the time of onset of the lesion (Ossowska et al., 2005)."@en ;

  dc:description "Neurotoxic effects shall be carefully addressed and reported in routine required regulatory toxicological studies (acute toxicity studies,short-term toxicity studies, long term toxicity and carcinogenicity studies and reproductive toxicity studies). Regarding neurotoxicity in rodents, inclusion of neurotoxicity investigations in routine toxicology studies shall also be considered. For pesticide active substances the circumstances in which neurotoxicity studies should be performed are listed in Regulation (EU) No 283/2013:  Specific neurotoxicity studies in rodents shall be performed in case of one those following conditions:   	there is indication of neurotoxicity in routine toxicity studies carried out with the active substance; 	the active substance is a structurally related to known neurotoxic compound; 	the active substance has a neurotoxic mode of pesticidal action.   As a result, specific neurotoxicity studies are not routinely required for all pesticide active substances. Specific neurotoxicity testing becomes obligatory only if neurotoxicity has been observed during histopathological evaluation or in case of structural analogy with a known neurotoxic compound. Motor activity should be measured once in short-term repeated dose toxicity studies (OECD 407, 408 and 422) and several times in specific neurotoxicity studies (OECD 424, OECD 426 and cohort 2 of OECD 443). However, this is not a requirement in chronic toxicity studies unless neurotoxic effects have been reported in the shorter studies. The same test (measures horizontal and/or vertical movements in a test chamber) is implemented in both routine studies and neurotoxicity studies. Coordination and balance are evaluated by rotation or rotarod or pole tests, and gait abnormalities by forepaw stride length test. Those tests are not required by any repeated dose toxicity OECD guidelines and they can be optionally incorporated in the design of neurotoxicity studies OECD 424 and OECD 426.  Although motor deficits is the AO in this AOP, degeneration of DA neurons, is also considered an adverse effect in the regulatory framework, even in the absence of clear clinical symptoms or motor deficits. Morphological assessment of brain structures is a standard requirement in the regulatory toxicological studies supporting the risk assessment of chemical substances and it is a regulatory expectation that the anatomical structures belonging to the nigrostriatal pathway would be included and evaluated as part of the standard evaluation of the brain. Treatment related neuronal degeneration, when occurring as a consequence of the treatment, is generally dose-dependent in incidence and severity. However, if not accompanied by clinical signs or behavioral changes indicative of central nervous system pathology, minimal loss of DA neurons would likely remain undetected in the standard histological evaluation, due to the presence of non DA neurons or as a consequence of the subjectivity of non-quantifiable analysis, unless specific markers are used. As multiple forms of perturbation can affect the neurons, some changes are potentially still reversible (e.g. loss of TH or DA) and irreversibility should be confirmed as part of the assessment. It is then important to apply a sensitive and appropriate method (Switzer 2000) and evaluation of the phenotypic markers in the striatum and in the SNpc should be always performed as a minimum standard (Minnema et al.,&nbsp;2014) when investigating perturbation of the nigrostriatal pathway. It should additionally consider that rat is likely to be a poor model to capture this kind of hazard, as demonstrated by the poor sensitivity of rat to MPTP or related compounds and this should be taken into account for the design and interpretation of the studies.  Dissimilarities of chemical induced animal models to human disease are also important and should be carefully weighted when considering the duration and schedule of the study/treatment. Differently from the human disease, with the MPTP animal model, the damage occurs rapidly, is hardly progressive, is little age-dependent and formation of Lewy bodies is sometime not occurring (Efremova et al., 2015). Therefore, for different animals models, the standard 90 days toxicity study could not match with the chronic and progressive characteristics of the human disease and compensatory changes influencing DA metabolism and turnover and protein catabolism can occur during the treatment period with an impact on the time of onset of the lesion (Ossowska et al., 2005)."@en ;

Many studies, have demonstrated that the type of radiation and distance from source has an impact on the pattern of energy deposition (Alloni, et al. 2014). High linear energy transfer (LET) radiation has been associated with higher-energy deposits (Liamsuwan et al., 2014) that are more densely-packed and cause more complex effects within the particle track (Hada and Georgakilas, 2008; Okayasu, 2012ab; Lorat et al., 2015; Nikitaki et al., 2016) in comparison to low LET radiation. Parameters such as mean lineal energy, dose mean lineal energy, frequency mean specific energy and dose mean specific energy can impact track structure of the traversed energy into a medium (Friedland et al., 2017). The detection of energy deposition by ionizing radiation can be demonstrated with the use of fluorescent nuclear track detectors (FNTDs). FNTDs used in conjunction with fluorescent microscopy, are able to visualize radiation tracks produced by ionizing radiation (Niklas et al., 2013; Kodaira et al., 2015; Sawakuchi and Akselrod, 2016). In addition, these FNTD chips can quantify the LET of primary and secondary radiation tracks up to 0.47 keV/um (Sawakuchi and Akselrod, 2016). This co-visualization of the radiation tracks and the cell markers enable the mapping of the radiation trajectory to specific cellular compartments, and the identification of accrued damage (Niklas et al., 2013; Kodaira et al., 2015).

  dc:description "Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) is a key enzyme of mitochondria, organelles that play a crucial role in the production of energy, the metabolic and calcium homeostasis, the control of apoptosis, and the production of reactive oxygen species. SDH is involved in two interconnected metabolic processes for energy production: 1) cellular respiration, where it allows the transfer of electrons to ubiquinone as complex II of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and 2) the Krebs cycle, where it catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate.   Numerous studies show that a complete inactivation of SDH caused by a first constitutional mutation associated with a second somatic mutation, leads to cancerous pathologies in young adults, including particularly aggressive forms of cancer such as paragangliomas (neuroendocrine tumors of the head and neck, thorax, abdomen and pelvis), pheochromocytomas (tumors of the adrenal medulla), renal cancers and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. The cellular and molecular mechanisms related to the genetic inactivation of SDH have been well described in neuroendocrine tumors, where it induces an oxidative stress, a pseudohypoxia phenotype, a metabolic, epigenetic and transcriptional remodeling, and alterations in tumor cell migration and invasion capacities, in connection with the accumulation of succinate, the substrate of SDH.  The succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHi) are fungicides used to control the proliferation of pathogenic fungi in cereal, fruit and vegetable crops, with a mode of action based on blocking the activity of SDH. The analysis of literature data shows that the impact of SDHi on health remains largely unexplored to date, despite a growing number of studies reporting toxic effects in non-target organisms. This is supported by our recent work highlighting 1) the high degree of conservation of the SDH catalytic site (i.e. the SDHi binding site) during the evolution and 2) the ability of SDHi to inhibit SDH in the mitochondria of non-target species, including humans (PMID: 31697708). These observations show that SDHi are not specific to fungal SDH and that their use may present a risk to human health, particularly in the context of chronic exposure through the diet. Moreover, the analysis of regulatory assessment reports shows that most SDHi induce tumors in animals without evidence of genotoxicity. Thus, for these substances, the mechanisms of carcinogenicity are, to date, not clearly established.&nbsp;   Our hypothesis is that, if SDHi fungicides are able to alter SDH activity in humans, the consequences of SDHi exposure on cellular and mitochondrial functions may resemble those observed in SDH-mutated tumors and SDH-deficient cells. We assume that the development of an AOP deciphering the different steps leading to cancer following a genetically-SDH inactivation could help to propose the exploration of relevant key events and adverse effects upon chronic exposure to SDHi fungicides.  &nbsp;"@en ;

Domoic acid (DomA) is structurally similar to kainic acid (KA) and both of them are analogues of the excitatory neurotransmitter L-glutamate. DomA induces excitotoxicity by an integrative action on ionotropic glutamate receptors at pre- and post-synaptic sides. DomA directly activates KA/AMPARs receptors followed by indirect activation of the NMDARs. Indeed, indirect activation of NMDARs by DomA is linked to the fact that KA and AMPA receptors activated by DomA induce increased levels of intracellular Ca2+ and Na+ which, in turn, causes endogenous glutamate release that subsequently potentiates activation of NMDARs (Berman and Murray, 1997; Berman et al., 2002; Watanabe et al., 2011). DomA has been demonstrated through both in vitro and in vivo approaches to indirectly activate the NMDARs (reviewed in Pulido et al., 2008).  Glufosinate (GLF)((RS)-2-amino-4-(hydroxy(methyl)phosphonoyl)butanoic acid, phosphinothricin) is a phosphorus containing amino acid herbicide that is naturally occurring as a component of the bacteria-derived bactericidal and fungicidal tripeptides bialaphos and phosalacine (Lanz et al., 2014). There are studies suggesting that convulsive and amnesic effects of GLF are mediated through direct binding and activation of NMDAR (Lantz et al., 2014; Matsumura et al., 2001). GLF agonist action at the NMDAR is expected to occur through direct interaction with the glutamate binding site and requires binding of the glycine co-agonist as well as release of the magnesium block from the channel pore."@en ;

  dc:description "A prime example of impairments in learning and memory as the adverse outcome for regulatory action is developmental lead exposure and IQ function in children (Bellinger, 2012). Most methods are well established in the published literature and many have been engaged to evaluate the effects of developmental thyroid disruption. The US EPA and OECD Developmental Neurotoxicity (DNT) Guidelines (OCSPP 870.6300 or OECD TG 426) as well as OECD TG 443 (OECD, 2018) both require testing of learning and memory (USEPA, 1998; OECD, 2007) advising to use the following tests passive avoidance, delayed-matching-to-position for the adult rat and for the infant rat, olfactory conditioning, Morris water maze, Biel or Cincinnati maze, radial arm maze, T-maze, and acquisition and retention of schedule-controlled behavior. These DNT Guidelines have been deemed valid to identify developmental neurotoxicity and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes (Makris et al., 2009).&nbsp;  Also, in the frame of the OECD GD 43 (2008) on reproductive toxicity, learning and memory testing may have potential to be applied in the context of developmental neurotoxicity studies. However, many of the learning and memory tasks used in guideline studies may not readily detect subtle impairments in cognitive function associated with modest degrees of developmental thyroid disruption (Gilbert et al., 2012).&nbsp;  &nbsp;"@en ;

  rdfs:label "Binding of chemicals to ionotropic glutamate receptors leads to impairment of learning and memory via loss of drebrin from dendritic spines of neurons"@en ;

  dc:description "Drebrin, identified by our group in 1985, has been a central focus of our research for many years. This actin-binding protein is known to exist in two isoforms: drebrin E and drebrin A. Drebrin E is expressed in both neuronal and certain non-neuronal cells, and it plays a crucial role during fetal and early postnatal stages of brain development. In neurons, drebrin E is involved in processes essential for cell motility, neurite outgrowth, and the extension of axons and dendrites, which together contribute to the establishment of neural networks. In contrast, drebrin A is a neuron-specific isoform whose expression is initiated during the synaptic formation stage. Drebrin A is indispensable for the formation and maintenance of dendritic spines, which serve as the primary sites for excitatory synaptic transmission, largely mediated by glutamate receptors. During brain development, drebrin E, which predominates in the early stages, is gradually replaced by drebrin A during synaptogenesis, reflecting their distinct roles in neuronal development, excitatory synapse formation&nbsp;and&nbsp;synaptic plasticity.  Based on the dynamic expression patterns and functional properties of drebrin, we have proposed an Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) framework for assessing developmental neurotoxicity and neurotoxicity. Monitoring drebrin gene expression levels, subcellular localization in neurons, and protein levels provides valuable insights into brain development and higher-order brain functions across various species.  In 2017, we summarized our research findings in a monograph titled Drebrin: From Structure and Function to Physiological and Pathological Roles, published as part of Springer&rsquo;s Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology series.  Between 2020 and 2023, we initiated the development of an AOP for neurotoxicity and developmental neurotoxicity caused by glutamate receptor-binding agonists, supported by a three-year research grant from the Japan Chemical Industry Association (JCIA) Long-range Research Initiative (LRI). This project, entitled &quot;Proposal of a new AOP for the neurotoxicity and developmental neurotoxicity assessment of glutamate receptor binding agonists that cause learning and memory impairment,&quot; identified a novel adverse outcome (AO): learning and memory impairment. This AO is characterized by key events, including the loss of drebrin from dendritic spines, leading to thin and elongated spine morphology and subsequent synaptic dysfunction. Drebrin, as a key regulator of dendritic spine morphology, plays an essential role in the structural plasticity associated with learning and memory. Furthermore, the subcellular localization of drebrin is dynamically influenced by glutamate receptor activity.  To advance these studies, we optimized Banker&rsquo;s method for low-density neuronal cultures and developed an immunocytochemical evaluation system for drebrin clusters in hippocampal neurons using a 96-well plate format and frozen embryonic hippocampal neurons from rats. In addition, we designed a high-content imaging algorithm for the quantitative analysis of neuronal parameters, including neuron count, dendrite length, and drebrin clustering, using confocal image cytometry. Notably, our brightness distribution analysis of drebrin clusters demonstrated exceptional sensitivity, allowing for precise quantification of structural changes in neurons. These methodological advancements have enabled us to establish standardized protocols (SOPs) for both neuronal culture techniques and analytical procedures.  We plan to extend this research by developing an experimental system utilizing neurons derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), thereby enhancing the relevance and applicability of our findings to human brain development and function.  &nbsp;"@en ;

  dc:description "It is well documented that ionizing radiation( (eg.&nbsp;X-rays, gamma, photons, alpha, beta, neutrons, heavy ions)&nbsp;leads to energy deposition on the atoms and molecules of the substrate. Many studies, have demonstrated that the type of radiation and distance from source has an impact on the pattern of energy deposition (Alloni, et al. 2014). High linear energy transfer (LET) radiation has been associated with higher-energy deposits (Liamsuwan et al., 2014) that are more densely-packed and cause more complex effects within the particle track (Hada and Georgakilas, 2008; Okayasu, 2012ab; Lorat et al., 2015; Nikitaki et al., 2016) in comparison to low LET radiation. Parameters such as mean lineal energy, dose mean lineal energy, frequency mean specific energy and dose mean specific energy can impact track structure of the traversed energy into a medium (Friedland et al., 2017). The detection of energy deposition by ionizing radiation can be demonstrated with the use of fluorescent nuclear track detectors (FNTDs). FNTDs used in conjunction with fluorescent microscopy, are able to visualize radiation tracks produced by ionizing radiation (Niklas et al., 2013; Kodaira et al., 2015; Sawakuchi and Akselrod, 2016). In addition, these FNTD chips can quantify the LET of primary and secondary radiation tracks up to 0.47 keV/um (Sawakuchi and Akselrod, 2016). This co-visualization of the radiation tracks and the cell markers enable the mapping of the radiation trajectory to specific cellular compartments, and the identification of accrued damage (Niklas et al., 2013; Kodaira et al., 2015).

  dc:description "Cataracts, one of the leading causes of blindness, are a progressive condition in which the lens of the eye develops opacities and becomes cloudy, resulting in blurred vision as well as glare and haloes around lights (National Eye Institute, 2022). For this AOP, a cataract is defined when over 5% of the lens is opacified. Cataracts typically occur after the age of 50 in humans, as an age-related disease (Liu et al., 2017); however, progression of this disease can be initiated or accelerated after exposure to a variety of agents, one of which is radiation.&nbsp;&nbsp;  For radiation induced cataracts, most research shows that the anatomical location is within the posterior sub capsular region of the eye with limited occurrence in the cortical and nuclear region. Available epidemiological evidence confirms a positive statistically significant association between radiation exposure and cataracts (Nakashima et al., 2006; Worgul et al., 2007; Chylack et al., 2012; Little et al., 2018). The data comes from Chernobyl workers, radiologic technologists, and patients exposed to radiation through medical procedures, with the most compelling evidence derived from atomic bomb survivors. Although there is concern for the role of long duration space flight missions in cataract formation, there is limited data from astronauts.&nbsp;&nbsp;  In 2012, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) recommended lowering the occupational eye lens dose limit from 150 mSv per year to an average of 20 mSv, with no single year exceeding 50 mSv. This revision was based on new evidence from both radiobiological studies and relevant epidemiological data. Assessment of the literature indicated a threshold dose for radiation induced cataracts of about 0.5 Gy (ICRP, 2012). This change in exposure limit has led to a need to further understand radiation-induced effects at lower doses and dose-rates.&nbsp;It is believed the progression of cataracts at high&nbsp; doses and s higher dose-rates generally induce more damage than lower dose-rates (Brooks et al., 2016).  This AOP provides a summary of the relevant studies and endpoints that can inform future research designed to understand the role of radiation in causing cataracts. Assays and study designs spanning biological levels of organization across relevant models were identified, with the end goal to improve testing strategies and understanding in risk from low dose low dose-rate exposures.&nbsp;"@en ;

Domoic acid (DomA) is structurally similar to kainic acid (KA) and both of them are analogues of the excitatory neurotransmitter L-glutamate. DomA induces excitotoxicity by an integrative action on ionotropic glutamate receptors at pre- and post-synaptic sides. DomA directly activates KA/AMPARs receptors followed by indirect activation of the NMDARs. Indeed, indirect activation of NMDARs by DomA is linked to the fact that KA and AMPA receptors activated by DomA induce increased levels of intracellular Ca2+ and Na+ which, in turn, causes endogenous glutamate release that subsequently potentiates activation of NMDARs (Berman and Murray, 1997; Berman et al., 2002; Watanabe et al., 2011). DomA has been demonstrated through both in vitro and in vivo approaches to indirectly activate the NMDARs (reviewed in Pulido et al., 2008).  Glufosinate (GLF)((RS)-2-amino-4-(hydroxy(methyl)phosphonoyl)butanoic acid, phosphinothricin) is a phosphorus containing amino acid herbicide that is naturally occurring as a component of the bacteria-derived bactericidal and fungicidal tripeptides bialaphos and phosalacine (Lanz et al., 2014). There are studies suggesting that convulsive and amnesic effects of GLF are mediated through direct binding and activation of NMDAR (Lantz et al., 2014; Matsumura et al., 2001). GLF agonist action at the NMDAR is expected to occur through direct interaction with the glutamate binding site and requires binding of the glycine co-agonist as well as release of the magnesium block from the channel pore."@en ;

The US EPA and OECD Developmental Neurotoxicity (DNT) Guidelines (OCSPP 870.6300 or OECD TG 426) as well as OECD TG 443 (OECD, 2018) both require testing of learning and memory (USEPA, 1998; OECD, 2007) advising to use the following tests passive avoidance, delayed-matching-to-position for the adult rat and for the infant rat, olfactory conditioning, Morris water maze, Biel or Cincinnati maze, radial arm maze, T-maze, and acquisition and retention of schedule-controlled behavior.

  dc:description "Bone loss, as observed in a variety of conditions such as osteopenia and osteoporosis, is a skeletal disorder characterized by decreased bone density and quality resulting in porous, fracture-prone bones (Rachner, Khosla, and Hofbauer, 2011). In the United States, it has been estimated that 2 million fractures per year are due to osteoporosis, costing $57 billion per year from direct medical costs combined with productivity losses and informal caregiving (Lewiecki et al., 2019). Bone loss is more common in white women, and older people (Sozen, Ozisik, and Basaran, 2017). Risk factors for fractures include low body mass index, previous fractures, glucocorticoid treatment, and other conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and type 1 diabetes mellitus (Sozen, Ozisik, and Basaran, 2017).&nbsp;&nbsp;  Growing evidence suggests that acute and chronic radiation exposure can contribute to the loss of bone mass, bone strength and changed bone quality (Donaubauer et al., 2020; Willey et al., 2011; Willey et al., 2013; Wissing, 2015; Wright, 2018). Clinical studies have shown that skeletal sites receiving high doses of ionizing radiation (25 Gy or higher) have increased fracture risk (Baxter et al., 2005; Oeffinger et al., 2006; Willey et al., 2011). For example, radiotherapy for pelvic malignancies causes an increased risk of hip fractures (Baxter et al., 2005; Williams and Davies, 2006). Similarly, radiotherapy for breast cancer or rectal carcinoma has been shown to increase the risk of fracture to the ribs or pelvis/femoral neck, respectively (Holm et al., 1996; Overgaard, 1988). Low to moderate doses of radiation as received during long-term spaceflight contribute to bone loss (Stavnichuk et al., 2020; Willey et al., 2011), but is the focus of fewer studies. Radiation-induced bone loss has also been investigated through modeling-based approaches utilizing in vivo data to comprehend the underlying mechanisms of bone turnover (Ayati et al., 2010; Boaretti et al., 2023; Gerhard et al., 2009). Therefore, identifying essential early endpoints relevant to radiation-induced bone loss through the development of AOPs can inform mitigation strategies to reduce the risks from radiation exposures."@en ;

The detection of energy deposition by ionizing radiation can be demonstrated with the use of fluorescent nuclear track detectors (FNTDs). FNTDs used in conjunction with fluorescent microscopy, are able to visualize radiation tracks produced by ionizing radiation (Niklas et al., 2013; Kodaira et al., 2015; Sawakuchi and Akselrod, 2016). In addition, these FNTD chips can quantify the LET of primary and secondary radiation tracks up to 0.47 keV/um (Sawakuchi and Akselrod, 2016). This co-visualization of the radiation tracks and the cell markers enable the mapping of the radiation trajectory to specific cellular compartments, and the identification of accrued damage (Niklas et al., 2013; Kodaira et al., 2015). There are no known chemical initiators or prototypes that can mimic the MIE."@en ;

  dc:description "Understanding the impact of ionizing radiation on CNS is essential as there are many possibilities for humans to be exposed to ionizing radiation including from medical procedures, accidental or wartime exposures, and occupational exposures, such as industrial radiographers or astronaut crewmembers. Various studies have reported cognitive deficits after high-doses of radiation exposure from radiotherapy, though there is a reported individual variability in human cohorts (Greene-Schloesser et al., 2012; Katsura et al., 2021; Turnquist et al., 2020). In preclinical animal models, studies suggest that even low-to-moderate doses of ionizing radiation from heavy ions can cause structural and functional impairments to the CNS including reductions in neurogenesis, changes in dendritic properties, activation of glial cells, leading to neural remodeling (Cekanaviciute et al., 2018; Kiffer et al., 2019b). However, how key changes in structural and functional properties of the CNS from ionizing radiation exposure are related to changes in cognitive function have yet to be delineated. Furthermore, preclinical studies also suggest that ionizing radiation may impact two major cognitive processes: learning and memory. Learning is the ability to create new associative or non-associative relationships and memory is the ability to recall sensory, short-term or long-term information (Desai et al., 2022, Kiffer et al., 2019b). Both learning and memory involve multiple brain areas including the hippocampal region, as well as the amygdala, the prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia (Cucinotta et al., 2014; Desai et al., 2022; NCRP Commentary, 2016). The link between learning and memory is complexly intertwined, as their processes share mechanisms such as changes in neuronal plasticity, alternations in neurotransmitter release and reuptake and alterations in gray and white matter structure (Toricelli et al., 2021). Thus far, direct pathways linking ionizing radiation to key cellular and molecular events leading to an AO of impaired learning and memory have not been established.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This AOP can serve as a foundational pathway for expansion to other cognitive disorders and CNS diseases from an MIE of deposition of energy. The strength of this AOP is in its rigorous and systematic collection and evaluation of evidence with moderate to high levels of qualitative evidence supporting the KERs.&nbsp;&nbsp;"@en ;

  dc:description "The exposome concept, proposed by C.P. Wild in 2005, gathers all exposure sources (environmental chemicals, biological agents, physical &amp; socio-economic factors...) to which an individual is subjected, from conception to death (Wild, C. P., 2005). Complementary to the genome approach, the exposome is an important notion for the understanding of how gene-environment interactions trigger diseases (Vineis, P.,&nbsp;et al., 2020). The environmental contribution to the development of chronic diseases could be in the range of 70% to 90% (Rappaport, S. M., &amp; Smith, M. T., 2010).  Agrochemicals that include biocides, herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides contribute chronically and significantly to the chemical exposome worldwide due to their extensive use in agriculture and domestic environments. In Europe, different families of man-made pesticides have been used in waves since the 1950s, notably in agriculture. For example, the organochlorines (e.g., DDT) were replaced by organophosphates (OPs), which are now progressively replaced by pyrethroids. Despite their gradual substitutions by pyrethroids in Europe, some OPs including chlorpyrifos (CPF), are still widely used and sometimes benefit from exemptions for their use (e.g., France, spinach cultivation). Recently, the National Institute of Health and Medical Research in France (INSERM) published a collective expert report identifying strong presumed risks associated with exposure to OPs (INSERM, 2022)&nbsp;(non-Hodgkin&#39;s lymphomas or cognitive disorders in adults and altered motor, cognitive and sensory capacities in children due to exposure during pregnancy).  Although exposure to risk factors increases the probability of acquiring an adverse outcome, the window, timespan, and dose of exposure are elements to be considered when assessing the hazardousness of a chemical. In line with the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) theory, which emphasizes linkage between prenatal and postnatal exposure to environmental factors and the risk of developing several diseases later in life (Gluckman, P. D.,&nbsp;et al., 2008), the perinatal period is a critical window of high vulnerability for neurodevelopment (Silbereis, J. C., et al., 2016). Therefore, children&rsquo;s exposure to environmental pollutants (through contaminated food/air/water, direct contact through crop spraying, domestic use, etc.), may result in behavioral and/or cognitive disorders, potentially persistent through adult life (Arora, M., et al., 2017).  To have a better understanding of the putative involvement from the chemical exposome to health effects, new and innovative methods are needed. New Approaches Methodologies (NAMs) or next generation risk assessment (NGRA), referring to non-animal- based approaches, can provide information on chemical hazards and inform risk assessment (van der Zalm, A. J., et al., 2022). In 2010, Ankley&nbsp;et al. formalized the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) framework&nbsp;which compile existing biological knowledge in a structured linear representation at various levels of the biological organization (molecular, cellular, individual, etc.) (Ankley, G. T., et al., 2010).&nbsp;Advancements in technologies, coupled with an uptick in data volume and the availability of diverse toxicological data from various sources (omics, high throughput assays, literature), facilitate the development of complex, but realistic toxicological models including AOPs (Kleinstreuer, N., &amp; Hartung, T., 2024). As the AOP construction could be very time-intensive to compile existing heterogeneous knowledge from structured- and non-structured data, innovative computational methods based on artificial intelligence (AI), and data mining technologies are well suited. AI allows to identify, extract, and compile relevant sparse information from the wealth of available open-source data, and can be used for predictive toxicology (e.g., Abstract Sifter (Baker, N., et al., 2017), the ComptoxAI tools (Hartung T., 2023; Lin, Z., &amp; Chou, W. C. 2022)) or others computational&nbsp;approaches (Baudiffier, D., et al., 2024).  Recently, AI and text-mining were used to develop AOP-helpFinder (Carvaillo, J. C., et al., 2019; Jaylet, T., et al., 2023), a tool to automatically identify, extract, and prioritize knowledge from the literature (PubMed). AOP-helpFinder has already been successfully used in several studies, as well as in the development of novel AOPs that were submitted to the AOP-Wiki database (e.g., AOP IDs 439, 441, 490, 493, 494 and 497).  The AOP concept can be extended to the socio-economic consequences of AOs (or diseases) beyond its biological information (MIE and KE). Diseases may cause suffering, moral distress, loss of earnings, and set limits in the present and future life of affected individuals in addition to decrease their quality of life, as many dimensions that are not captured by the depiction of the biological KEs in AOP. Due to these consequences, and the need for healthcare and other social cares (psychological support, economic support, ...), AOs may imply costs to the society that need to be reflected in AOPs as relevant consequences from chemical exposure. Notwithstanding the fact that there are studies that have already outlined, e.g., disability-adjusted life years due to diseases (Menzies, N. A., et al., 2023),&nbsp;the socio-economic costs of disease need to be more often considered and formalized, particularly in the case of exposome-induced diseases.  Here we proposed a new concept, the Cost Outcome Pathway (COP) that integrates the socio-economical cost (Cost Outcome, CO) into the AOP framework. As a case study, one AOP related to agrochemicals exposure (OPs including CPF) during neurodevelopment was designed using the AOP-helpFinder tool and scientific expertise&rsquo;s. The proposed AOP was extended to a COP, by adding a &lsquo;socio-economic KER&rsquo; describing socio-economic consequence."@en ;

  dc:description "Regulatory significance of the socio-economic burden&nbsp;refers to the extent to which the quantification and understanding of economic and socio-economic costs influence public policy, regulatory frameworks, and resource allocation. When the economic burden of an issue (such as a disease, environmental hazard, or social determinant) is demonstrated to be substantial, it can serve as a compelling rationale for government intervention.  This information can&nbsp;inform policymakers&nbsp;about the&nbsp;adverse effects of various exposures, such as environmental pollutants&nbsp;or socio-economic stressors. By structuring the associated socio-economic burden, it provides evidence-based insights that can guide&nbsp;regulatory action,&nbsp;risk assessment, and&nbsp;preventive strategies&nbsp;aimed at mitigating harm and protecting public health.  Policymakers have a vested interest not only in&nbsp;protecting public health and well-being, but also in&nbsp;reducing the economic burden&nbsp;associated with preventable exposures. Effective regulation can thus serve a dual purpose: safeguarding the population while simultaneously&nbsp;alleviating financial pressures&nbsp;on healthcare systems, social services, and the broader economy.  From the human perspective, diseases such as cancer or obesity (or recently Covid-19) do not represent the&nbsp;end point of a toxicity pathway (AOP), but rather the beginning of a&nbsp;broader set of socio-economic consequences. These conditions often lead to a&nbsp;cascade of burdens, including&nbsp;direct costs&nbsp;(such as medical treatment, care and reduced salary),&nbsp;indirect costs&nbsp;(such as productivity loss and long-term disability), and&nbsp;intangible costs&nbsp;(such as psychological distress and diminished quality of life). As such, the full impact of these diseases extends well beyond clinical outcomes, underscoring the need for comprehensive public health and regulatory responses."@en ;

  dc:description "The exposome concept, proposed by C.P. Wild in 2005, gathers all exposure sources (environmental chemicals, biological agents, physical &amp; socio-economic factors...) to which an individual is subjected, from conception to death (Wild, C. P., 2005). Complementary to the genome approach, the exposome is an important notion for the understanding of how gene-environment interactions trigger diseases (Vineis, P.,&nbsp;et al., 2020). The environmental contribution to the development of chronic diseases could be in the range of 70% to 90% (Rappaport, S. M., &amp; Smith, M. T., 2010).  Agrochemicals that include biocides, herbicides, fungicides, and insecticides contribute chronically and significantly to the chemical exposome worldwide due to their extensive use in agriculture and domestic environments. In Europe, different families of man-made pesticides have been used in waves since the 1950s, notably in agriculture. For example, the organochlorines (e.g., DDT) were replaced by organophosphates (OPs), which are now progressively replaced by pyrethroids. Despite their gradual substitutions by pyrethroids in Europe, some OPs including chlorpyrifos (CPF), are still widely used and sometimes benefit from exemptions for their use (e.g., France, spinach cultivation). Recently, the National Institute of Health and Medical Research in France (INSERM) published a collective expert report identifying strong presumed risks associated with exposure to OPs (INSERM, 2022)&nbsp;(non-Hodgkin&#39;s lymphomas or cognitive disorders in adults and altered motor, cognitive and sensory capacities in children due to exposure during pregnancy).  Although exposure to risk factors increases the probability of acquiring an adverse outcome, the window, timespan, and dose of exposure are elements to be considered when assessing the hazardousness of a chemical. In line with the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) theory, which emphasizes linkage between prenatal and postnatal exposure to environmental factors and the risk of developing several diseases later in life (Gluckman, P. D.,&nbsp;et al., 2008), the perinatal period is a critical window of high vulnerability for neurodevelopment (Silbereis, J. C., et al., 2016). Therefore, children&rsquo;s exposure to environmental pollutants (through contaminated food/air/water, direct contact through crop spraying, domestic use, etc.), may result in behavioral and/or cognitive disorders, potentially persistent through adult life (Arora, M., et al., 2017).  To have a better understanding of the putative involvement from the chemical exposome to health effects, new and innovative methods are needed. New Approaches Methodologies (NAMs) or next generation risk assessment (NGRA), referring to non-animal- based approaches, can provide information on chemical hazards and inform risk assessment (van der Zalm, A. J., et al., 2022). In 2010, Ankley&nbsp;et al. formalized the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) framework&nbsp;which compile existing biological knowledge in a structured linear representation at various levels of the biological organization (molecular, cellular, individual, etc.) (Ankley, G. T., et al., 2010).&nbsp;Advancements in technologies, coupled with an uptick in data volume and the availability of diverse toxicological data from various sources (omics, high throughput assays, literature), facilitate the development of complex, but realistic toxicological models including AOPs (Kleinstreuer, N., &amp; Hartung, T., 2024). As the AOP construction could be very time-intensive to compile existing heterogeneous knowledge from structured- and non-structured data, innovative computational methods based on artificial intelligence (AI), and data mining technologies are well suited. AI allows to identify, extract, and compile relevant sparse information from the wealth of available open-source data, and can be used for predictive toxicology (e.g., Abstract Sifter (Baker, N., et al., 2017), the ComptoxAI tools (Hartung T., 2023; Lin, Z., &amp; Chou, W. C. 2022)) or others computational&nbsp;approaches (Baudiffier, D., et al., 2024).  Recently, AI and text-mining were used to develop AOP-helpFinder (Carvaillo, J. C., et al., 2019; Jaylet, T., et al., 2023), a tool to automatically identify, extract, and prioritize knowledge from the literature (PubMed). AOP-helpFinder has already been successfully used in several studies, as well as in the development of novel AOPs that were submitted to the AOP-Wiki database (e.g., AOP IDs 439, 441, 490, 493, 494 and 497).  The AOP concept can be extended to the socio-economic consequences of AOs (or diseases) beyond its biological information (MIE and KE). Diseases may cause suffering, moral distress, loss of earnings, and set limits in the present and future life of affected individuals in addition to decrease their quality of life, as many dimensions that are not captured by the depiction of the biological KEs in AOP. Due to these consequences, and the need for healthcare and other social cares (psychological support, economic support, ...), AOs may imply costs to the society that need to be reflected in AOPs as relevant consequences from chemical exposure. Notwithstanding the fact that there are studies that have already outlined, e.g., disability-adjusted life years due to diseases (Menzies, N. A., et al., 2023),&nbsp;the socio-economic costs of disease need to be more often considered and formalized, particularly in the case of exposome-induced diseases.  Here we proposed a new concept, the Cost Outcome Pathway (COP) that integrates the socio-economical cost (Cost Outcome, CO) into the AOP framework. As a case study, one AOP related to agrochemicals exposure (OPs including CPF) during neurodevelopment was designed using the AOP-helpFinder tool and scientific expertise&rsquo;s. The proposed AOP was extended to a COP, by adding a &lsquo;socio-economic KER&rsquo; describing socio-economic consequence."@en ;

Most methods are well established in the published literature and many have been engaged to evaluate the effects of developmental thyroid disruption. The US EPA and OECD Developmental Neurotoxicity (DNT) Guidelines (OCSPP 870.6300 or OECD TG 426) as well as OECD TG 443 (OECD, 2018) both require testing of learning and memory (USEPA, 1998; OECD, 2007) advising to use the following tests passive avoidance, delayed-matching-to-position for the adult rat and for the infant rat, olfactory conditioning, Morris water maze, Biel or Cincinnati maze, radial arm maze, T-maze, and acquisition and retention of schedule-controlled behavior. These DNT Guidelines have been deemed valid to identify developmental neurotoxicity and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes (Makris et al., 2009).&nbsp;  Also, in the frame of the OECD GD 43 (2008) on reproductive toxicity, learning and memory testing may have potential to be applied in the context of developmental neurotoxicity studies. However, many of the learning and memory tasks used in guideline studies may not readily detect subtle impairments in cognitive function associated with modest degrees of developmental thyroid disruption (Gilbert et al., 2012).&nbsp;  &nbsp;"@en ;

The etiology of OFCs is complex with approximately 50% of CPO and 70% of CL/P considered non-syndromic (2011). SHH signaling is required for normal facial development and plays a critical role in the growth of the facial processes that form the upper palate and lip (Bush and Jiang 2012, Kurosaka 2015). The epithelial derived SHH drives orofacial development through an induced gradient in the underlying mesenchyme&nbsp; (Lan and Jiang 2009, Kurosaka 2015). This gradient of SHH induces cellular proliferation and outgrowth of the mesenchyme (Lan and Jiang 2009). The SHH pathway is sensitive to chemical disruption and can be disrupted at multiple places along the signaling cascade during critical windows for exposure and has been shown to cause OFCs (Lipinski and Bushman 2010, Heyne, Melberg et al. 2015). The targets of this disruption include ligand modification, ligand secretion, downstream sensing, and signal transduction (Jeong and McMahon 2002, Lauth, Bergstr&ouml;m et al. 2007, Petrova, Rios-Esteves et al. 2013). Chemical modulators of the SHH pathway through antagonism of SMO have been identified including the natural alkaloid cyclopamine, both natural and synthetic pharmaceuticals, and a pesticide synergist (PBO) (Lipinski, Dengler et al. 2007, Lipinski, Song et al. 2010, Wang, Lu et al. 2012, Everson, Sun et al. 2019, Rivera-Gonz&aacute;lez, Beames et al. 2021)."@en ;

  dc:source <https://h2020-sbd4nano.github.io/sbd-data-aopwiki/models/> ;
  dc:description "The AHR can be activated by several structurally diverse chemicals, but binds preferentially to planar halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Dioxin-like compounds (DLCs), which include polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and certain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), are among the most potent AHR ligands[38]. Only a subset of PCDD, PCDF and PCB congeners has been shown to bind to the AHR and cause toxic effects to those elicited by TCDD. Until recently, TCDD was considered to be the most potent DLC in birds[39]; however, recent reports indicate that 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (PeCDF) is more potent than TCDD in some species of birds.[40][13][41][21][42][43] When screened for their ability to induce aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) activity, dioxins with chlorine atoms at a minimum of three out of the four lateral ring positions, and with at least one non-chlorinated ring position are the most active[44]. Of the dioxin-like PCBs, non-ortho congeners are the most toxicologically active, while mono-ortho PCBs are generally less potent[45][9]. Chlorine substitution at ortho positions increases the energetic costs of assuming the coplanar conformation required for binding to the AHR [45]. Thus, a smaller proportion of mono-ortho PCB molecules are able to bind to the AHR and elicit toxic effects, resulting in reduced potency of these congeners. Other PCB congeners, such as di-ortho substituted PCBs, are very weak AHR agonists and do not likely contribute to dioxin-like effects [9].   	Contrary to studies of birds and mammals, even the most potent mono-ortho PCBs bind to AhRs of fishes with very low affinity, if at all (Abnet et al 1999; Doering et al 2014; 2015; Eisner et al 2016; Van den Berg et al 1998).   The role of the AHR in mediating the toxic effects of planar hydrophobic contaminants has been well studied, however the endogenous role of the AHR is less clear [1]. Some endogenous and natural substances, including prostaglandin PGG2 and the tryptophan derivatives indole-3-carbinol, 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ) and kynurenic acid can bind to and activate the AHR. [6][46][47][48][49] The AHR is thought to have important endogenous roles in reproduction, liver and heart development, cardiovascular function, immune function and cell cycle regulation [50][38][51][52][53][54][46][55][56][57] and activation of the AHR by DLCs may therefore adversely affect these processes."@en ;

  dc:description "Understanding the biological link between Ah receptor (AhR) activation and liver fibrosis holds significant relevance due to its implications in the pathogenesis of various liver diseases. Liver fibrosis represents a common pathological process underlying the progression of chronic liver disorders, including hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Notably, NAFLD, characterized by hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, has become a global health concern, closely associated with obesity, metabolic syndrome, and insulin resistance. Given that AhR activation has been implicated in the regulation of lipid metabolism and inflammation, elucidating its role in liver fibrosis provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms driving NAFLD progression. Moreover, the interconnected nature of liver diseases underscores the importance of investigating AhR-mediated pathways as potential therapeutic targets for the management of liver fibrosis and its comorbidities, including hepatic steatosis. Therefore, establishing a biological link between AhR activation and liver fibrosis not only enhances our understanding of disease pathogenesis but also offers promising avenues for the development of targeted therapies for liver-related disorders."@en ;

  dc:source <https://h2020-sbd4nano.github.io/sbd-data-aopwiki/models/> ;
  dc:description "Uterine (endometrial) adenocarcinoma (UA), the most common uterine cancer, is a type of cancer that arises in the layer of cells that form the inner epithelial lining of the uterus (endometrium). Based on clinical, pathological and molecular features, uterine adenocarcinomas in humans have been classified into two broad categories: type I and type II (Sherman, 2000).   Type I adenocarcinoma is the most common type, accounting for approximately 80% of cases. It is often referred as endometrioid adenocarcinoma since it is a well differentiated (low grade) tumor characterized by a glandular growth pattern resembling normal endometrial epithelium. Clinically, is often characterized by a favorable prognosis. Type I adenocarcinoma is estrogen-dependent, estrogen-receptor-positive and arises in a background of endometrial hyperplasia. It can be polypoid or infiltrative, the latter can spread transmurally through the uterine wall and to adjacent organs. Involvement of regional lymph nodes can occur and, in advanced stages, the tumor may metastasize to distant organs including lungs, liver, bones, and other organs (Robbins and Cotran, 2015).   Type II adenocarcinoma comprises about 10-20% of UA cases and has a non-endometrioid morphology. It is non-estrogen-dependent, estrogen-receptor-negative and has a serous, papillary, or clear cell morphology (Sherman, 2000). Clinically, it is characterized by an aggressive clinical course, and a propensity for early spread and poor prognosis (Bansal et al. 2009). It arises in a background of endometrial atrophy. This classification that sub-divide uterine adenocarcinomas into types I and II is not completely accurate since a minority of endometrial cancers may exhibit shared characteristics (Bansal et al. 2009).   The dependence of Type I uterine adenocarcinoma on estrogens is supported by different epidemiologic observations:   - the raised incidence rate for uterine adenocarcinoma in the population in conjunction with widespread use of unopposed estrogen replacement therapy in menopause (Sherman 2000)   - the decreased incidence with the decline in the use of this hormone preparations (Sherman 2000)   - the increased risk of UA as a consequence of the use of oral contraceptives based on estrogens (Weiss et al. 1976; 1980)   - the 2 to 3 times increase in the relative risk of developing UA in patients under tamoxifen therapy, due to its agonistic action on estrogen receptors in endometrial tissue (Passarello et al. 2019).   Prolonged estrogenic stimulation of the endometrium is associated with atypical endometrial hyperplasia (Sherman 2000). Endometrial hyperplasia is characterized by an increased (pathological) proliferation of the endometrial epithelial cells compared with normal proliferative endometrium.  &nbsp;"@en ;

  dc:description "In 2002, the World Health Organisation (WHO) through its International Programme for Chemical Safety, proposed a definition for endocrine disruptors (ED) and in 2009 a definition of adverse effects. Upon endorsement of those definition by the European Food Safety Authority, the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety and the consensus of the scientific community, criteria for the determination of ED properties pursuant to Regulations (EU) No 528/20125 and (EC) No 1107/20096 have been set as defined in Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 2017/21007 and Commission Regulation (EU) No 2018/6058. According to these criteria, a substance shall be considered as having ED properties if accomplish all the following conditions:  a) it shows an adverse effect in [an intact organism or its progeny]/[non-target organisms], which is a change in the morphology, physiology, growth, development, reproduction or life span of an organism, system or (sub)population that results in an impairment of functional capacity, an impairment of the capacity to compensate for additional stress or an increase in susceptibility to other influences;  b) it has endocrine mode of action, i.e. it has the potential to alter the function(s) of the endocrine system;  c) the adverse effect is a consequence of the endocrine mode of action.&rdquo;  Conclusions as to whether a substance meet the ED criteria must be drawn, as requested by Regulations (EU) No 528/20125 and (EC) No 1107/20096.  Uterine endometrioid adenocarcinoma is common outcome to hormones exposure (Henderson et al., 1982). Hormones, by promoting cell proliferation, allow accumulation of random genetic mutations due to DNA replication errors which may give rise to a malignant phenotype (Henderson et al., 1982). Epidemiological studies suggest potential roles for estrogenic EDs in increased risk of endometrial cancer, although the understanding of the direct role of EDs and the molecular mechanisms involved is still inconclusive (Gore et al. 2015).  Being the classification of endocrine disrupter (ED) a cut-off criteria for chemical substances used as pesticides and / or biocides, it appears of importance, in case of detection of uterine adenocarcinoma in the toxicology experiments necessary for authorization, to establish whether this effect is implemented through an endocrine-mediated mechanism.  Establishing a direct link between the occurrence of rodent EC due to ED exposure and an endocrine mode of action relevant to humans is difficult due to the multifactorial nature of carcinogenesis. It is thus necessary to establish the existence of a biologically plausible link between EC and endocrine activity.   The proposed AOP is addressing a regulatory endpoint represented by the increase in uterine weight (or uterotrophic response) that is elicited by ER agonists in animal models (Uterotrophic Bioassay in Rodents (UT assay) (OECD TG 440) and carcinogenicity studies (OECD TG 451)."@en ;

  dc:description "Sudden cardiac death caused by arrhythmias is a major concern in cardiotoxicity, especially in the context of pharmaceutical development and chemical safety assessment. Many drugs and chemicals can inadvertently block cardiac ion channels, such as the hERG potassium channel, leading to arrhythmogenic events. The ability to predict and mitigate such risks early in the development process is critical for ensuring patient safety and regulatory compliance.  This AOP, &quot;Cardiac Ion Channel Blockade Leading to increased incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.&quot; provides a mechanistic understanding of how ion channel blockade initiates a series of cellular and tissue-level events, ultimately resulting in a fatal adverse outcome. By defining the sequence of molecular and physiological changes and their relationships, the AOP serves as a structured framework to guide the evaluation of cardiotoxic risks. It is particularly relevant in areas such as drug screening, environmental toxicology, and the development of computational models for safety assessment. The application of this AOP extends to identifying compounds with ion channel blocking properties, designing safer drugs, and supporting regulatory decision-making by incorporating mechanistic data into risk assessment frameworks. This approach aligns with the principles of evidence-based toxicology, offering a pathway to more predictive and reliable safety assessments."@en ;

  dc:source <https://h2020-sbd4nano.github.io/sbd-data-aopwiki/models/> ;
  dc:description "Thyroid Disrupting Chemicals (TDCs) are defined as the xenobiotics that interfere with the thyroid axis with different outcomes for the organism. A very well-studied mechanism of action of the TDCs is the reduction of the circulating levels of THs by inhibiting hormone synthesis in the thyroid gland. For example, perchlorate is a very potent inhibitor of iodide uptake through the sodium/iodide symporter (Tonacchera et al., 2004). Perchlorate has been detected in human breast milk ranging from 1.4 to 92.2 mg &mu;l&ndash;1 (10.5 &mu;g l&ndash;1 mean) in 18 US states (Kirk et al. 2005), and 1.3 to 411 &mu;g l&ndash;1 (9.1 &mu;g l&ndash;1 median) in the Boston area, United States (Pearce et al. 2007). Perchlorate has also been detected in human colostrum of 46 women in the Boston area (from &lt; 0.05 to 187.2 &mu;mol l&ndash;1 (Leung et al. 2009)). The mechanism of perchlorate action is quite simple, as it is believed to be mediated only by the NIS inhibition (Dohan et al., 2007; Wolff, 1998). Additionally, thiocyanate and nitrate are two known inhibitors that have been found to reduce circulating TH levels (Blount et al., 2006; Steinhaus et al., 2007), but they are both less potent than perchlorate (Tonacchera et al., 2004). However, there are also contradictory results from other studies that showed no correlation between thyroid parameters and perchlorate levels in humans (Pearce et al., 2010; Amitai et al., 2007; Tellez et al., 2005).  Co-occurrence of perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate can alter thyroid function in pregnant women. Horton et al. (2015) have shown positive associations between the weighted sum of urinary concentrations of these three analytes and increased TSH, with perchlorate showing the largest weight in the index. Interestingly, De Groef et al. 2006 showed that nitrate and thiocyanate, acquired through drinking water or food, account for a much larger proportion of iodine uptake inhibition than perchlorate, suggesting that NIS inhibition and any potential downstream effect by perchlorate are highly dependent on the presence of other environmental NIS inhibitors and iodine intake itself (Leung et al., 2010). In particular, Tonacchera et al. (2004) showed that the relative potency of perchlorate to inhibit radioactive I&minus; uptake by NIS is 15, 30 and 240 times that of thiocyanate, iodide, and nitrate respectively on a molar concentration basis. These data are in line with earlier studies in rats (Alexander and Wolff, 1996; Greer et al. 1966). Contradictory findings in these studies may therefore be a result of the confounding mixtures in the environment, masking the primary effect of perchlorate.  Decreased iodine intake can decrease TH production, and therefore exposure to perchlorate might be particularly detrimental in iodine-deficient individuals (Leung et al. 2010). Moreover, biologically based dose-response modeling of the relationships among iodide status (e.g., dietary iodine levels), perchlorate dose, and TH production in pregnant women has shown that iodide intake has a profound effect on the likelihood that exposure to goitrogens will produce hypothyroxinemia (Lewandowski et al. 2015).  During pregnancy TH requirements increase, particularly during the first trimester (Alexander et al. 2004; Leung et al. 2010), due to higher concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, placental T4 inner-ring deiodination leading to the inactive reverse T3 (rT3), and transfer of small amounts of T4 to the foetus (during the first trimester foetal thyroid function is absent). Moreover, glomerular filtration rate and clearance of proteins and other molecules are both increased during pregnancy, possibly causing increased renal iodide clearance and a decreased of circulating plasma iodine (Glinoer, 1997). Thus, even though the foetal thyroid can trap iodide by about 12 week of gestation (Fisher and Klein, 1981), high concentrations of maternal perchlorate may potentially decrease thyroidal iodine available to the foetus by inhibiting placental NIS (Leung et al. 2010).  Consequences of TH deficiency depend on the developmental timing of the deficiency (Zoeller and Rovet, 2004). For instance, if the TH deficiency occurs during early pregnancy, offspring show visual attention, visual processing and gross motor skills deficits, while if it occurs later, offspring may show subnormal visual and visuospatial skills, along with slower response speeds and motor deficits. If TH insufficiency occurs after birth, language and memory skills are most predominantly affected (Zoeller and Rovet, 2004).  Along this line, age and developmental stage are crucial in determining sensitivity to NIS inhibitors (e.g., perchlorate, thiocyanate, and nitrate). In this regard, McMullen et al. (2017) have shown that adolescent boys and girls, more than adults, represent vulnerable subpopulations to NIS symporter inhibitors. Altogether these studies indicate that age, gender, developmental stage, and dietary iodine levels can affect the impact of NIS inhibitors.  Finally, ten more small simple-structured molecules were identified in a large screening study (Lecat-Guillet et al., 2008b) that could block iodide uptake by specifically disrupting NIS in a dose-dependent manner. These molecules were named Iodide Transport Blockers (ITBs). There are few organic molecules that lead to NIS inhibition but no direct interaction with NIS has been determined (Gerard et al., 1994; Kaminsky et al., 1991). Up to date, only dysidenin, a toxin isolated from the marine sponge Dysidea herbacea, has been reported to specifically inhibit NIS (Van Sande et al., 2003). Finally, the aryltrifluoroborates were found to inhibit iodide uptake with an IC50 value of 0.4 &mu;M on rat-derived thyroid cells (Lecat-Guillet et al., 2008a). The biological activity is rationalized by the presence of the BF3&minus; ion as a minimal binding motif for substrate recognition at the iodide binding site.  It has been also shown that many anions, such as ClO3-, SCN-, NO3-, ReO4-, TcO4- and in a lower extent Br- and BF4-, are also acting as NIS substrates and they enter the cell by the same transporter mechanism (Van Sande et al., 2003). It has been also shown that ClO4- is transferred by NIS with high affinity and is considered as one of its most potent inhibitors (Dohan et al., 2007). Most recently, the aryltrifluoroborates were also shown to inhibit NIS function (Lecat-Guillet et al., 2008a). A library of 17,020 compounds was tested by a radioactive screening method with high specificity using transfected mammalian cells (Lecat-Guillet et al., 2008b; 2007) for NIS inhibition evaluation. Further studies with the most powerful inhibitors showed a high diversity in their structure and mode of action (Lindenthal et al., 2009)."@en ;

Most methods are well established in the published literature and many have been engaged to evaluate the effects of developmental thyroid disruption. The US EPA and OECD Developmental Neurotoxicity (DNT) Guidelines (OCSPP 870.6300 or OECD TG 426) as well as OECD TG 443 (OECD, 2018) both require testing of learning and memory (USEPA, 1998; OECD, 2007) advising to use the following tests passive avoidance, delayed-matching-to-position for the adult rat and for the infant rat, olfactory conditioning, Morris water maze, Biel or Cincinnati maze, radial arm maze, T-maze, and acquisition and retention of schedule-controlled behavior. These DNT Guidelines have been deemed valid to identify developmental neurotoxicity and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes (Makris et al., 2009).&nbsp;  Also, in the frame of the OECD GD 43 (2008) on reproductive toxicity, learning and memory testing may have potential to be applied in the context of developmental neurotoxicity studies. However, many of the learning and memory tasks used in guideline studies may not readily detect subtle impairments in cognitive function associated with modest degrees of developmental thyroid disruption (Gilbert et al., 2012).&nbsp;  &nbsp;"@en ;

  dc:description "The AHR can be activated by several structurally diverse chemicals, but binds preferentially to planar halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Dioxin-like compounds (DLCs), which include polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and certain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), are among the most potent AHR ligands[38]. Only a subset of PCDD, PCDF and PCB congeners has been shown to bind to the AHR and cause toxic effects to those elicited by TCDD. Until recently, TCDD was considered to be the most potent DLC in birds[39]; however, recent reports indicate that 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (PeCDF) is more potent than TCDD in some species of birds.[40][13][41][21][42][43] When screened for their ability to induce aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) activity, dioxins with chlorine atoms at a minimum of three out of the four lateral ring positions, and with at least one non-chlorinated ring position are the most active[44]. Of the dioxin-like PCBs, non-ortho congeners are the most toxicologically active, while mono-ortho PCBs are generally less potent[45][9]. Chlorine substitution at ortho positions increases the energetic costs of assuming the coplanar conformation required for binding to the AHR [45]. Thus, a smaller proportion of mono-ortho PCB molecules are able to bind to the AHR and elicit toxic effects, resulting in reduced potency of these congeners. Other PCB congeners, such as di-ortho substituted PCBs, are very weak AHR agonists and do not likely contribute to dioxin-like effects [9].   	Contrary to studies of birds and mammals, even the most potent mono-ortho PCBs bind to AhRs of fishes with very low affinity, if at all (Abnet et al 1999; Doering et al 2014; 2015; Eisner et al 2016; Van den Berg et al 1998).   The role of the AHR in mediating the toxic effects of planar hydrophobic contaminants has been well studied, however the endogenous role of the AHR is less clear [1]. Some endogenous and natural substances, including prostaglandin PGG2 and the tryptophan derivatives indole-3-carbinol, 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ) and kynurenic acid can bind to and activate the AHR. [6][46][47][48][49] The AHR is thought to have important endogenous roles in reproduction, liver and heart development, cardiovascular function, immune function and cell cycle regulation [50][38][51][52][53][54][46][55][56][57] and activation of the AHR by DLCs may therefore adversely affect these processes."@en ;

  dc:description "Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have been specifically designed to inhibit cyclooxygenase active site of PTGS; these mechanisms of inhibition are well characterized (Simmons et al, 2004). NSAIDs interfere with COX site via multiple mechanisms including competitive inhibition (most NSAIDs compete for active site with arachidonic acid) and covalent modification (irreversible acetylation) of COX (e.g., aspirin) (Simmons et al., 2004; Willoughby et al., 2011). NSAIDs display different levels of selectivity for the COX-1 vs. COX-2 isoforms (Simmons et al., 2004).

NSAIDs display different levels of selectivity for the COX-1 vs. COX-2 isoforms (Simmons et al., 2004).

  dc:description "Thyroid Disrupting Chemicals (TDCs) are defined as the xenobiotics that interfere with the thyroid axis with different outcomes for the organism. A very well-studied mechanism of action of the TDCs is the reduction of the circulating levels of THs by inhibiting hormone synthesis in the thyroid gland. For example, perchlorate is a very potent inhibitor of iodide uptake through the sodium/iodide symporter (Tonacchera et al., 2004). Perchlorate has been detected in human breast milk ranging from 1.4 to 92.2 mg &mu;l&ndash;1 (10.5 &mu;g l&ndash;1 mean) in 18 US states (Kirk et al. 2005), and 1.3 to 411 &mu;g l&ndash;1 (9.1 &mu;g l&ndash;1 median) in the Boston area, United States (Pearce et al. 2007). Perchlorate has also been detected in human colostrum of 46 women in the Boston area (from &lt; 0.05 to 187.2 &mu;mol l&ndash;1 (Leung et al. 2009)). The mechanism of perchlorate action is quite simple, as it is believed to be mediated only by the NIS inhibition (Dohan et al., 2007; Wolff, 1998). Additionally, thiocyanate and nitrate are two known inhibitors that have been found to reduce circulating TH levels (Blount et al., 2006; Steinhaus et al., 2007), but they are both less potent than perchlorate (Tonacchera et al., 2004). However, there are also contradictory results from other studies that showed no correlation between thyroid parameters and perchlorate levels in humans (Pearce et al., 2010; Amitai et al., 2007; Tellez et al., 2005).  Co-occurrence of perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate can alter thyroid function in pregnant women. Horton et al. (2015) have shown positive associations between the weighted sum of urinary concentrations of these three analytes and increased TSH, with perchlorate showing the largest weight in the index. Interestingly, De Groef et al. 2006 showed that nitrate and thiocyanate, acquired through drinking water or food, account for a much larger proportion of iodine uptake inhibition than perchlorate, suggesting that NIS inhibition and any potential downstream effect by perchlorate are highly dependent on the presence of other environmental NIS inhibitors and iodine intake itself (Leung et al., 2010). In particular, Tonacchera et al. (2004) showed that the relative potency of perchlorate to inhibit radioactive I&minus; uptake by NIS is 15, 30 and 240 times that of thiocyanate, iodide, and nitrate respectively on a molar concentration basis. These data are in line with earlier studies in rats (Alexander and Wolff, 1996; Greer et al. 1966). Contradictory findings in these studies may therefore be a result of the confounding mixtures in the environment, masking the primary effect of perchlorate.  Decreased iodine intake can decrease TH production, and therefore exposure to perchlorate might be particularly detrimental in iodine-deficient individuals (Leung et al. 2010). Moreover, biologically based dose-response modeling of the relationships among iodide status (e.g., dietary iodine levels), perchlorate dose, and TH production in pregnant women has shown that iodide intake has a profound effect on the likelihood that exposure to goitrogens will produce hypothyroxinemia (Lewandowski et al. 2015).  During pregnancy TH requirements increase, particularly during the first trimester (Alexander et al. 2004; Leung et al. 2010), due to higher concentrations of thyroxine-binding globulin, placental T4 inner-ring deiodination leading to the inactive reverse T3 (rT3), and transfer of small amounts of T4 to the foetus (during the first trimester foetal thyroid function is absent). Moreover, glomerular filtration rate and clearance of proteins and other molecules are both increased during pregnancy, possibly causing increased renal iodide clearance and a decreased of circulating plasma iodine (Glinoer, 1997). Thus, even though the foetal thyroid can trap iodide by about 12 week of gestation (Fisher and Klein, 1981), high concentrations of maternal perchlorate may potentially decrease thyroidal iodine available to the foetus by inhibiting placental NIS (Leung et al. 2010).  Consequences of TH deficiency depend on the developmental timing of the deficiency (Zoeller and Rovet, 2004). For instance, if the TH deficiency occurs during early pregnancy, offspring show visual attention, visual processing and gross motor skills deficits, while if it occurs later, offspring may show subnormal visual and visuospatial skills, along with slower response speeds and motor deficits. If TH insufficiency occurs after birth, language and memory skills are most predominantly affected (Zoeller and Rovet, 2004).  Along this line, age and developmental stage are crucial in determining sensitivity to NIS inhibitors (e.g., perchlorate, thiocyanate, and nitrate). In this regard, McMullen et al. (2017) have shown that adolescent boys and girls, more than adults, represent vulnerable subpopulations to NIS symporter inhibitors. Altogether these studies indicate that age, gender, developmental stage, and dietary iodine levels can affect the impact of NIS inhibitors.  Finally, ten more small simple-structured molecules were identified in a large screening study (Lecat-Guillet et al., 2008b) that could block iodide uptake by specifically disrupting NIS in a dose-dependent manner. These molecules were named Iodide Transport Blockers (ITBs). There are few organic molecules that lead to NIS inhibition but no direct interaction with NIS has been determined (Gerard et al., 1994; Kaminsky et al., 1991). Up to date, only dysidenin, a toxin isolated from the marine sponge Dysidea herbacea, has been reported to specifically inhibit NIS (Van Sande et al., 2003). Finally, the aryltrifluoroborates were found to inhibit iodide uptake with an IC50 value of 0.4 &mu;M on rat-derived thyroid cells (Lecat-Guillet et al., 2008a). The biological activity is rationalized by the presence of the BF3&minus; ion as a minimal binding motif for substrate recognition at the iodide binding site.  It has been also shown that many anions, such as ClO3-, SCN-, NO3-, ReO4-, TcO4- and in a lower extent Br- and BF4-, are also acting as NIS substrates and they enter the cell by the same transporter mechanism (Van Sande et al., 2003). It has been also shown that ClO4- is transferred by NIS with high affinity and is considered as one of its most potent inhibitors (Dohan et al., 2007). Most recently, the aryltrifluoroborates were also shown to inhibit NIS function (Lecat-Guillet et al., 2008a). A library of 17,020 compounds was tested by a radioactive screening method with high specificity using transfected mammalian cells (Lecat-Guillet et al., 2008b; 2007) for NIS inhibition evaluation. Further studies with the most powerful inhibitors showed a high diversity in their structure and mode of action (Lindenthal et al., 2009)."@en ;

The potency of a nAChR agonist is dependent on the receptor subunit composition, structurally important amino acid residues at the binding site, and the ionization status of the chemical at physiological pH (Tomizawa and Casida, 2003; Dani and Bertrand, 2007). For example, nicotine is a classical vertebrate nAChR agonist; however, it has relatively low affinity (and insecticidal activity) for the invertebrate nAChR. Due to ionization, nicotine is poor at passing though the ion-impermeable barrier surrounding the insect central nervous system(CNS; Tomizawa and Casida, 2003).

  dc:description "Text from LaLone et al. (2017) Weight of evidence evaluation of a network of adverse outcome pathways linking activaiton of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in honey bees to colony death. Science of the Total Environment 584-585, 751-775:  &quot;The nicotinoids and neonicotinoids are both agonists of the nAChR (Tomizawa and Casida, 2003); however, neonicotinoids are the primary chemicals considered in the AOPs relevant to bees. The potency of a nAChR agonist is dependent on the receptor subunit composition, structurally important amino acid residues at the binding site, and the ionization status of the chemical at physiological pH (Tomizawa and Casida, 2003; Dani and Bertrand, 2007). For example, nicotine is a classical vertebrate nAChR agonist; however, it has relatively low affinity (and insecticidal activity) for the invertebrate nAChR. Due to ionization, nicotine is poor at passing though the ion-impermeable barrier surrounding the insect central nervous system(CNS; Tomizawa and Casida, 2003). Conversely, non-ionizable neonicotinoids readily translocate into the insect CNS and have high affinity for the nAChR (e.g., Drosophila nAChR IC50 4.6 nM imidacloprid), with limited or no binding activity to vertebrate nAChR (Tomizawa and Casida, 2003). Various studies have demonstrated that similarities and differences in key amino acid residues in the ligand binding domain across species can lead to structural and binding site differences that dictate chemical interaction with the receptor (Dani and Bertrand, 2007; Matsuda et al., 2009; Tomizawa and Casida, 2009; Jones and Sattelle, 2010; LaLone et al., 2016). Due to the intended insecticidal action of neonicotinoids, a growing number of studies have been conducted to  evaluate potential adverse effects in non-target species such as honey bees exposed to neonicotinoids, particularly imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam.

  dc:description "Although global lead exposure has significantly declined since the phase-out of leaded gasoline, it remains a pervasive issue, particularly in low- and middle-income countries&nbsp;(Larsen et al., 2023; Li et al., 2014). A report by The Lancet points out that there are still 815 million (One third of global children) children worldwide with blood lead concentrations exceeding 50 &mu;g/L (Burki&nbsp;et al., 2020). DNA methylation is an important bridge to link environmental pollutants and adverse outcomes. FAM50B has relatively high expression in human brain (https://tissues.jensenlab.org). We screened two genes (FAM50B and PTCHD3) that mediated lead exposure and children&#39;s IQ and neurodevelopment through multiple epidemiological studies, and FAM50B/PTCHD3 methylation had good quantitative relationships with chidren&#39;s IQ and neurodevelopment (Wan et al., 2021; 2024). The identified FAM50B/PTCHD3 DNA methylation biomarkers could aid in developing early diagnostic tools and targeted treatments for neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as in quantitative environmental health risk assessments for heavy metals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"@en ;

(2022) provided network analysis focused on mechanisms of action for copper toxicity in aquatic vertebrates through literature searches. &nbsp;Literature searches provided the following mechanisms of copper toxicity: disruption of ion regulation; oxidative stress; effects on liver metabolism; effects on bioenergetics leading to impaired growth and reproduction; effects on sensory systems; effects on amphibian metabolism. &nbsp;These mechanisms were the basis for examining empirical studies for development of key events and key event relationships within an adverse outcome pathway framework.&nbsp; Freshwater organisms are hypertonic (higher ion concentration) compared to the aquatic environment while salt-water organisms are hypotonic (lower ion concentration) compared to the aquatic environment; therefore osmoregulation in freshwater organisms versus salt-water organisms regulate ion concentrations and fluid volumes in opposite directions.&nbsp; Decrease in Sodium/Potassium ATPase activity and the resulting adverse outcome pathway were observed in freshwater vertebrates, primarily fish (Brix et al. 2022).  The authors of AOP 539 focused on disruption of ion regulation as the priority adverse outcome pathway to develop, because of the strength of &nbsp;evidence linking the various key event relationships and the eventual adverse outcome. &nbsp;"@en ;

  dc:description "Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) is a key enzyme of mitochondria, organelles that play a crucial role in the production of energy, the metabolic and calcium homeostasis, the control of apoptosis, and the production of reactive oxygen species. SDH is involved in two interconnected metabolic processes for energy production : 1) cellular respiration, where it allows the transfer of electrons to ubiquinone as complex II of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and 2) the Krebs cycle, where it catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate.   Numerous studies show that a complete genetic inactivation of SDH caused by a first constitutional mutation associated with a second somatic mutation, leads to cancerous pathologies in young adults, including particularly aggressive forms of cancer such as paragangliomas (neuroendocrine tumors of the head and neck, thorax, abdomen and pelvis), pheochromocytomas (tumors of the adrenal medulla), renal cancers and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. The cellular and molecular mechanisms related to the genetic inactivation of SDH have been well described in neuroendocrine tumors, where it induces an oxidative stress, a pseudohypoxia phenotype, a metabolic, epigenetic and transcriptional remodeling, and alterations in tumor cell migration and invasion capacities, in connection with the accumulation of succinate, the substrate of SDH.  The succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHi) are fungicides used to control the proliferation of pathogenic fungi in cereal, fruit and vegetable crops, with a mode of action based on blocking the activity of SDH. The analysis of literature data shows that the impact of SDHi on health remains largely unexplored to date, despite a growing number of studies reporting toxic effects in non-target organisms. This is supported by our recent work highlighting 1) the high degree of conservation of the SDH catalytic site (i.e. the SDHi binding site) during the evolution and 2) the ability of SDHi to inhibit SDH in the mitochondria of non-target species, including humans (PMID: 31697708). These observations show that SDHi are not specific to fungal SDH and that their use may present a risk to human health, particularly in the context of chronic exposure through the diet. Moreover, the analysis of regulatory assessment reports shows that most SDHi induce tumors in animals without evidence of genotoxicity. Thus, for these substances, the mechanisms of carcinogenicity are, to date, not clearly established.&nbsp;   Our hypothesis is that, if SDHi fungicides are able to alter SDH activity in humans, the consequences of SDHi exposure on cellular and mitochondrial functions may resemble those observed in SDH-mutated tumors and SDH-deficient cells. We assume that the development of an AOP deciphering the different steps leading to cancer following a genetically-SDH inactivation could help to propose the exploration of relevant key events and adverse effects upon chronic exposure to SDHi fungicides."@en ;

  dc:description "OPIDN is a somewhat rare but serious disease with over 70,000 reported cases in the past century, although this is thought to be underestimated as there is a disproportionately high use of organophosphate pesticides in developing countries but over half of these reported cases came from the United States alone (Merwin, Obis, Nunez, &amp; Re, 2017). When OPIDN does occur, delayed neuropathy can present in various degrees of severity with not only incredibly painful physical symptoms but also emotional distress as cramping and muscle pains progress to weakness and, in severe cases, paralysis. While some people make a full recovery from OPIDN, the residual sensory and autonomic dysfunction can last for years, and in some cases never recovers at all (Eaton, et al., 2008; Jokanović, Kosanović, Brkić, &amp; Vukomanović, 2011). Ultimate prognosis is believed to be more dependent on CNS effects, with some cases even showing a worsening of symptoms over time rather than improvement (Jokanović, Kosanović, Brkić, &amp; Vukomanović, 2011). Despite the severity of symptoms, there remains no specific treatment available for OPIDN patients (Faria, et al., 2018). Accordingly, there would be great benefit to understanding the molecular pathway of this disease as a possibility to develop preventative strategies or therapies that can mitigate symptoms and improve health outcomes.  Developments of AOP networks surrounding organophosphate esters have been previously proposed. In the last few years, a number of papers have been published attempting to devise extensive AOP networks on organophosphate compounds that include a variety of MIEs and AOs (Yan, et al., 2021; Wang, Li, Teng, Ji, &amp; Wu, 2022; He, et al., 2024). However, these networks often have little to no focus on neurotoxicity and tend to focus more on differences between specific organophosphates leading to alternative AOs with underdeveloped or incomplete mechanisms linking initiating events and the various toxic endpoints. In most cases, there is a lack of a comprehensive KE pathway, no development of KERs, and no mention of NTE inhibition or the subsequent KEs outlined in the pathway that is proposed here. Aside from these above mentioned AOP networks, it has been noted previously that NTE inhibition is a widely accepted starting point for development of an AOP on OPIDN and that disruption of LPC homeostasis is likely involved (Faria, et al., 2018).

  dc:description "Celiac disease may be considered as a public health problem as it increases the overall mortality risk, reduces quality of life and yields extensive negative economic consequences. Although majority of patients experienced a good and long life after the diagnosis, a subgroup may develop complications such as T-cell lymphoma (Lindfors et al., 2019; Dieterich et al., 1997).  Although Swedish epidemiological study of coeliac disease in the mid-1980s88 suggests that coeliac disease may be prevented by the early introduction of small quantities of gluten into the diet of young children, two systematic reviews and meta- analyses have concluded that the timing of gluten introduction and the duration or maintenance of breastfeeding do not influence the development of coeliac disease. The use of primitive wheat varieties (kamut, einkorn and others) or the use of oats to reduce the clinical symptoms have not been shown in proper trials (Lindfors et al., 2019).  About 20&ndash;50% of patients with coeliac disease have persistent or recurrent symptoms despite a long- term gluten- free diet, usually due to other gastrointestinal disorders (irritable bowel syndrome, lactose intolerance&hellip;) or inadvertent gluten exposure. To avoid this last one, US FDA in 2013 or EU 828/2014 enforced regulations to labelling products defining &ldquo;gluten free&rdquo; as less than 20 mg/kg when measured by an approved system for testing, normally gluten-analysis R5 ELISA (Mendez), as less than 20ppm is considered safe in celiac disease patients. Although there are a good range of products available, these products are often inadequately labelled, less palatable, and more expensive, causing non-adherence to a strict gluten free diet. Managing the disease involves an active effort from the patient to regulate feelings, actions and reactions during any social activity that involves food (Lindfors et al., 2019)."@en ;

  dc:description "In 2017, the EFSA GMO Panel published a guidance document (EFSA, 2017)&nbsp;that, for the first time, outlined a specific risk assessment strategy to predict the capacity of innovative or novel proteins to trigger celiac disease. This strategy, characterized by an integrated, stepwise, case-by-case approach, was made possible due to the well-documented pathogenesis of celiac disease and the known proteins involved. Specifically, gluten peptides presented by the disease-predisposing Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) class II molecules, HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8, activate pro-inflammatory T-cells in the inflamed intestines of patients.  Ongoing efforts to refine risk assessment methodologies in this area are driven by new findings that suggest proteins from sources other than cereals may pose a hazard to individuals with celiac disease (Peterson et al., 2019)&nbsp;. This AOP is created to integrate the scientific knowledge into a conceptual framework in the regulatory context.  The risk assessment strategy developed for evaluating the potential of innovative or novel proteins to induce celiac disease is regarded as a benchmark, serving as an inspiration for the broader food safety assessment of novel proteins in the food sector.      &nbsp;"@en ;

  dc:description "A prime example of impairments in learning and memory as the adverse outcome for regulatory action is developmental lead exposure and IQ function in children (Bellinger, 2012). Most methods are well established in the published literature and many have been engaged to evaluate the effects of developmental thyroid disruption. The US EPA and OECD Developmental Neurotoxicity (DNT) Guidelines (OCSPP 870.6300 or OECD TG 426) as well as OECD TG 443 (OECD, 2018) both require testing of learning and memory (USEPA, 1998; OECD, 2007) advising to use the following tests passive avoidance, delayed-matching-to-position for the adult rat and for the infant rat, olfactory conditioning, Morris water maze, Biel or Cincinnati maze, radial arm maze, T-maze, and acquisition and retention of schedule-controlled behavior. These DNT Guidelines have been deemed valid to identify developmental neurotoxicity and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes (Makris et al., 2009).&nbsp;  Also, in the frame of the OECD GD 43 (2008) on reproductive toxicity, learning and memory testing may have potential to be applied in the context of developmental neurotoxicity studies. However, many of the learning and memory tasks used in guideline studies may not readily detect subtle impairments in cognitive function associated with modest degrees of developmental thyroid disruption (Gilbert et al., 2012).&nbsp;  &nbsp;"@en ;

  dc:description "Poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large group of fluorinated compounds that have a wide variety of commercial and industrial applications ranging from use in firefighting foams to non-stick coatings to fishing lines (DeWitt, et al. 2019; Annunziato et al. 2020; Gl&uuml;ge et al. 2020).&nbsp; PFAS exposure can have negative effects on development, growth, reproduction, hepatic function, immune function, neurological function, and lipid metabolism in humans and other vertebrates (Sunderland et al. 2019; Lee et al. 2020; Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), 2021; Ankley et al. 2021; Bell et al. 2021; Fragki et al. 2021; Ho et al. 2021; Boyd et al. 2022).&nbsp; Research in terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates has shown the liver to be a target organ of PFAS accumulation and resulting hepatoxicity (Lee et al. 2020; Costello et al. 2022; Ducatman and Fenton 2022; Huang et al. 2022a; Wang et al. 2022b).&nbsp; Here we propose an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) linking the binding of a specific PFAS, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) as the molecular initiating event (MIE) causing perturbation of PPAR-linked lipid metabolism which ultimately results in the adverse outcome (AO) of liver steatosis in PFOS-exposed vertebrates.  PPARs are a family of nuclear receptors in vertebrates that bind lipids as signaling molecules resulting in a cascade of transcriptional regulatory events that maintain energy homeostasis (Grygiel-Gorniak 2014).&nbsp; Specifically, PPAR&alpha; is integral in regulating fatty acid catabolism and energy production through beta-oxidation; PPAR&gamma; regulates fatty acid synthesis and storage; and PPAR&beta;/&delta; plays a key role in glucose homeostasis and beta-oxidation (Varga et al. 2011; Grygiel-Gorniak 2014; Lamas-Bervejillo and Ferreira 2019; Gust et al. 2019).&nbsp; Despite their more discrete roles, the crosstalk between all PPAR isoforms is essential to maintaining energy homeostasis; and therefore, any over-activation or repression of the PPAR signaling network can have deleterious outcomes for the organism."@en ;

  dc:source <https://h2020-sbd4nano.github.io/sbd-data-aopwiki/models/> ;
  dc:description "Several well-known drugs have lysosomotropic abilities including chloroquine, the antipsychotics chlorpromazine, thioridazine, aripiprazole, the antidepressants desipramine, imipramine, and clomipramine, as well as fluoroquinolone antibiotics; another substance group are lysosomotropic detergents (Villamil Giraldo et al., 2014; Ouedraogo et al., 2000).  Fluoroquinolones such as lomefloxacin, norfloxacin,&nbsp; BAYy 3118 and ciprofloxacin are lysosomotropic substances because of their Lewis acid&ndash;base properties characterized by pKa nearby neutrality (Ouedraogo et al. 2000). The anti-malarial and anti-inflammatory agent chloroquine is a basic lipophilic and therefore lysosomotropic compound that accumulates in lysosomes via pH partitioning (Ashoor et al. 2013). 3-aminopropanal has the structure of a weak lysosomotropic base, concentrates within the acidic vacuolar compartment and causes lysosomal rupture (Yu et al., 2003). Artesunate preferably accumulates in the lysosomes (Yang et al., 2014)  Most nanoscale macromolecules and molecular assemblies are internalized through endocytosis upon contact with the cell membrane. Intracellular trafficking of NPs following endocytosis has been reported to be mediated via the endosomal pathway through early endosomes, late endosomes and then lysosomes (Gilleron et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2013; Ng et al., 2015).&nbsp; Verma and Stellacci showed that 3.4-nm gold NPs were taken up into macrophages via pinocytosis and 24 h after internalization they were found in lysosomes. This endocytic fate has also been observed for iron oxide NPs and fullerenes (Verma and Stellacci, 2010).  Jin et al. investigated the cytotoxicity of Nanotitanium dioxide TiO2 (an industrial material used as an additive in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and food colorants and able to penetrate the skin) in mouse fibroblast (L929) cells. They saw that TiO2 NPs were phagocytosed and encapsulated in the lysosomes (Jin et al. 2008).  The rate and mechanism of NP uptake are dependent on physiochemical causes related to the properties of the NPs and the cells, but also the local microenvironment (Zhang, 2015). Nanomaterial shape and size contribute significantly to their interaction with cells (Verma and Stellacci, 2010; Oh, 2014). Several reports showing that NPs of 20&mdash;50nm are taken up more rapidly than smaller or larger particles (Lu et al., 2009; Iversen et al., 2011; Dykman and Khlebtsov, 2014).  Other variables that could influence the uptake of a NP cargo include orientation, density and steric freedom of targeting ligands and surface groups (Cleal et al., 2013). Most NPs are first coated with serum proteins before they reach cell plasma membranes; endocytosis patterns of aggregated or agglomerated NPs differ from the one of individual NPs (Oh and Park, 2014).  Harush-Frenkel et al. compared the endocytosis into HeLa cells of NPs exposing either a negative or positive charge on their surface and found that the exposed charge significantly affected their ability to internalize as well as the cellular endocytosis mechanism utilized. Negatively charged NPs showed an inferior rate of endocytosis and did not utilize the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway, while positively charged NPs internalize rapidly primarily via clathrin-mediated pathways as well as macropinocytosis. When the clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathway is blocked positively charged NPs activate a compensatory endocytosis pathway that results in enhanced accumulation of NPs (Harush-Frenkel et al., 2007). In contrast, a higher uptake of negatively charged quantum dot NPs has been reported in HEK cells by Zhang and Monteiro-Riviere (2009).  Schuetz et al. demonstrated that positively charged SiNPs enter cells largely via dynamin 2-dependent caveolar internalization rather than clathrin-mediated endocytosis and accumulate in lysosomes (Schuetz et al., 2016).  Ng et al. have shown that the uptake of 20 nm size AuNPs in MRC5 lung fibroblasts and Chang liver cells was dependent upon clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Ng et al., 2014). Yang et al. studied the cellular uptake of ultra-small fluorescent gold nanoclusters (AuNCs) by HeLa cells and found that this energy-dependent process involved multiple mechanisms, with clathrin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis appearing to play a significant role, whereas the caveolin-mediated pathway contributing only to a lesser extent (Yang et al., 2013).&nbsp;  Gilleron et al. monitored the uptake of lipid NPs (LNPs) loaded with traceable siRNAs in different cell types in vitro and in mouse liver and found that LNPs enter cells by both constitutive and inducible pathways in a cell type-specific manner using clathrin-mediated endocytosis as well as macropinocytosis (Gilleron et al., 2013).  Saw et al. showed that the major uptake of confeito Au NP of 30 nm was both clathrin and caveolin mediated endocytosis, while for 60, 80 and 100 nm NP was via clathrin mediated pathway. Internalization by both clathrin and caveolin pathways explains higher cellular uptake of 30 nm Au NP compared to other ones (Saw et al., 2018). However, Brandenberger et al. showed that uptake of 30 nm citrate-cappedsphere Au NP was by a macroopinocytosis mechanism (Brandenberger et al., 2010).  It is obvious that not only size of NP, but also the surface property and shape are also important factors in the type of cellular uptake of NPs. As demonstrated earlier cationic NPs favor clathrin mediated endocytosis possibly due to electrostatic interaction with the cell surface receptors. However, not all the studies confirmed this preference of cationic NPs for clathrin mediated internalization. In contrast, caveolin mediated endocytosis occurs by interaction between hydrophobic group of NP with lipid raft on cell surface (Chakraborty and Jana, 2015). There is a connection between the endocytosis mechanism and the subcellular localization of the NPs. Clathrin mediated endocytosis leads to localization of NPs to the lysosome. Also, it has been found that if uptake of NPs occurs via both clathrin and lipid raft- mediated endocytosis, subcellular localization will also be mainly lysosomal. Caveolin mediated uptake of NPs is followed with formation of vesicles with neutral pH and transport to endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus or even nucleus (Rejman et al., 2005)"@en ;

The US EPA and OECD Developmental Neurotoxicity (DNT) Guidelines (OCSPP 870.6300 or OECD TG 426) as well as OECD TG 443 (OECD, 2018) both require testing of learning and memory (USEPA, 1998; OECD, 2007) advising to use the following tests passive avoidance, delayed-matching-to-position for the adult rat and for the infant rat, olfactory conditioning, Morris water maze, Biel or Cincinnati maze, radial arm maze, T-maze, and acquisition and retention of schedule-controlled behavior. These DNT Guidelines have been deemed valid to identify developmental neurotoxicity and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes (Makris et al., 2009).&nbsp;  Also, in the frame of the OECD GD 43 (2008) on reproductive toxicity, learning and memory testing may have potential to be applied in the context of developmental neurotoxicity studies.

  dc:description "The dysfunction of L-type calcium channels (LTCCs) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of severe cardiac arrhythmias and structural heart disease. LTCCs are pivotal in regulating calcium influx during the plateau phase of the cardiac action potential, maintaining normal cardiac excitation-contraction coupling. Dysfunctional LTCCs, whether due to genetic mutations (e.g., CACNA1C variants), pharmacological agents, or electrolyte imbalances, can disrupt the delicate balance of ionic currents necessary for proper cardiac function.  This AOP is particularly relevant in the context of QT interval prolongation, a widely recognized marker of delayed ventricular repolarization. QT prolongation, whether congenital or acquired, predisposes individuals to Torsades de Pointes (TdP), a potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmia. TdP is often episodic and can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation (VF), characterized by disorganized electrical activity and hemodynamic collapse. Furthermore, chronic or repeated arrhythmic episodes can impose sustained stress on the myocardium, leading to cardiomyopathy characterized by fibrosis, chamber dilation, and impaired contractility.  This AOP framework provides a mechanistic understanding of the progression from LTCC dysfunction to adverse cardiac outcomes, offering a valuable tool for multiple applications:   	Regulatory Toxicology: Screening&nbsp; chemicals for proarrhythmic risks, particularly QT prolongation and TdP potential. 	Risk Assessment: Assessing the cardiotoxic potential of pharmacological agents and environmental toxins.   Understanding this AOP is critical for advancing cardiovascular safety and guiding regulatory and clinical decision-making, especially in drug discovery and toxicology evaluations. It bridges the gap between molecular events and clinical outcomes, fostering better risk management strategies for heart failuare.  &nbsp;"@en ;

  dc:description "Inhibition of sodium channel conductance can contribute to the development of cardiomyopathy through its impact on cardiac electrophysiology, ion homeostasis, and mechanical function. Voltage-gated sodium channels, primarily Nav1.5 (encoded by SCN5A), are essential for rapid depolarization during the cardiac action potential. Inhibition of sodium channel conductance reduces the inward sodium current (INa), leading to slowed conduction velocity, conduction blocks, and increased susceptibility to arrhythmias. These electrical abnormalities impose hemodynamic stress on the myocardium, promoting maladaptive remodeling. Sodium channel inhibition also disrupts the sodium gradient, impairing the sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) and causing calcium overload, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and myocyte apoptosis. Chronic electromechanical dysfunction can lead to ventricular dilation and the progression of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Conditions associated with sodium channel inhibition include genetic mutations, such as SCN5A mutations in Brugada syndrome and Len&egrave;gre disease, drug-induced sodium channel blockade from Class I antiarrhythmics, and ischemia-induced sodium channel dysfunction. These pathologies manifest as arrhythmias, heart failure, and an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. Understanding the role of sodium channel inhibition in cardiomyopathy highlights the need for targeted interventions to prevent the progression of sodium channel-related cardiac dysfunction."@en ;

However, overstimulation of &beta;-ARs, caused by elevated catecholamine levels (e.g., during stress or drug administration) or exogenous &beta;-AR agonists, disrupts this balance, initiating a cascade of molecular and cellular events that increase susceptibility to arrhythmias. This AOP is especially relevant for assessing the cardiac safety of pharmaceuticals, understanding the impacts of environmental stressors, and addressing genetic or disease-related predispositions to arrhythmias. Developing this AOP framework is critical for supporting regulatory decision-making, guiding preclinical safety testing, and identifying early biomarkers of cardiac arrhythmias. By capturing the mechanistic details of &beta;-AR overactivation and its downstream effects, the AOP enhances our ability to predict and mitigate risks associated with pro-arrhythmic compounds and conditions.

  dc:description "The Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) for dysfunction of potassium ion channels leading to cardiomyopathy describes the mechanistic progression from impaired potassium ion channel function to structural and functional deterioration of the heart. Potassium ion channels, such as HERG (KCNH2), KCNQ1, and Kir2.x, are critical for cardiac repolarization. Dysfunction caused by genetic mutations, pharmacological blockade, or environmental stressors disrupts potassium efflux, initiating a cascade of adverse effects. The molecular initiating event (MIE), dysfunction of potassium ion channels, leads to prolonged action potential duration (APD), which manifests as QT interval prolongation on the electrocardiogram (ECG). Prolonged QT intervals increase susceptibility to early afterdepolarizations (EADs), which trigger arrhythmias such as ventricular tachycardia, Torsades de Pointes (TdP), and ventricular fibrillation (VF). This AOP is supported by robust empirical evidence linking potassium channel dysfunction to each key event (KE) and adverse outcome (AO). Prototypical stressors include genetic mutations (e.g., KCNH2 in Long QT Syndrome), pharmacological agents (e.g., sotalol, amiodarone, and dofetilide), and environmental factors such as hypokalemia and oxidative stress. Sex, age, and comorbidities act as modulating factors, with females and individuals with pre-existing cardiac conditions at higher risk. Life stage and taxonomic applicability extend across humans and preclinical animal models such as canines, guinea pigs, and rabbits, which share similar cardiac repolarization mechanisms. Understanding this AOP provides critical insights for toxicological risk assessment, drug safety evaluations, and therapeutic interventions targeting potassium ion channel dysfunction. It highlights the need for personalized approaches to mitigate the risk of cardiomyopathy in vulnerable populations."@en ;

Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are critical enzymes that regulate the levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cyclic GMP (cGMP), key secondary messengers involved in the modulation of cardiac function, particularly calcium handling and excitation-contraction coupling. Inhibition of PDEs, particularly PDE3 and PDE4 isoforms, results in the accumulation of cAMP, which activates protein kinase A (PKA). PKA hyperphosphorylates important regulatory proteins in cardiomyocytes, including ryanodine receptors (RyR2) and phospholamban (PLN). This hyperphosphorylation disrupts calcium homeostasis by increasing calcium leakage from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) into the cytosol, a condition known as calcium dysregulation. Dysregulated calcium cycling leads to cytosolic calcium overload, impairing myocardial contraction and relaxation. Furthermore, excessive calcium influx into mitochondria promotes the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), triggering oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction."@en ;

The OP and carbamate pesticides were synthesized specifically to act as inhibitors of AChE, with OPs developed from early nerve agents (e.g., sarin) and carbamate pesticides based on the natural plant alkaloid physostigmine (Ecobichon 2001). 	A positive and significant correlation between the log of the Eserine IC50 (in vitro) for AChE inhibition and the log Km value for the AChE in the fish and crustacea species has been reported, explaining 92% of the variation in enzyme inhibition (Monserrat and Bianchini, 2001). Similar success was found in relating the rate constants for inhibition of AChE in housefly and the pseudo first-order hydrolysis rate constant for active forms of OPs (Fukuto 1990).    	The open literature includes many studies on vertebrate and invertebrate species that demonstrate a clear dependence of AChE activity on the dose or concentration of the substance with increased concentrations leading to an increase in the inhibition of AChE (e.g., fish ( Karen et al., 2001), birds (Hudson et al., 1984 (see dimethoate and disulfoton), Grue and Shipley 1984; and Al-Zubaidy et al., 2011); cladocera (Barata et al., 2004); nematodes (Rajini et al., 2008); rodents (Roberts et al., 1988; and mollusk (Bianco et al., 2011)).

  dc:description "AOP: Inhibition of Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) Leading to Arrhythmias provides a mechanistic framework linking the disruption of acetylcholine (ACh) regulation at synapses to the development of cardiac arrhythmias. AChE is a critical enzyme responsible for breaking down ACh, a neurotransmitter that mediates parasympathetic signaling in the autonomic nervous system. When AChE is inhibited, ACh accumulates excessively at synaptic junctions, particularly within the cardiac parasympathetic system, leading to overstimulation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (M2 receptors) in the heart.&nbsp;The overstimulation of M2 receptors triggers potassium efflux through G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels (IK,ACh), resulting in hyperpolarization of cardiac cells. This disrupts the normal electrical activity of the heart by prolonging or destabilizing cardiac action potentials. The altered electrical signaling can cause conduction delays, reentrant circuits, and early afterdepolarizations (EADs), which ultimately manifest as bradyarrhythmias, tachyarrhythmias, or fibrillation.&nbsp; This AOP has applications in regulatory toxicology, where it can be used to screen for cardiotoxic effects of environmental toxins and pharmaceuticals, and in therapeutic development, where targeting intermediate key events (e.g., using muscarinic receptor antagonists) can help mitigate arrhythmias.

  dc:description "The AHR can be activated by several structurally diverse chemicals, but binds preferentially to planar halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Dioxin-like compounds (DLCs), which include polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and certain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), are among the most potent AHR ligands[38]. Only a subset of PCDD, PCDF and PCB congeners has been shown to bind to the AHR and cause toxic effects to those elicited by TCDD. Until recently, TCDD was considered to be the most potent DLC in birds[39]; however, recent reports indicate that 2,3,4,7,8-pentachlorodibenzofuran (PeCDF) is more potent than TCDD in some species of birds.[40][13][41][21][42][43] When screened for their ability to induce aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) activity, dioxins with chlorine atoms at a minimum of three out of the four lateral ring positions, and with at least one non-chlorinated ring position are the most active[44]. Of the dioxin-like PCBs, non-ortho congeners are the most toxicologically active, while mono-ortho PCBs are generally less potent[45][9]. Chlorine substitution at ortho positions increases the energetic costs of assuming the coplanar conformation required for binding to the AHR [45]. Thus, a smaller proportion of mono-ortho PCB molecules are able to bind to the AHR and elicit toxic effects, resulting in reduced potency of these congeners. Other PCB congeners, such as di-ortho substituted PCBs, are very weak AHR agonists and do not likely contribute to dioxin-like effects [9].   	Contrary to studies of birds and mammals, even the most potent mono-ortho PCBs bind to AhRs of fishes with very low affinity, if at all (Abnet et al 1999; Doering et al 2014; 2015; Eisner et al 2016; Van den Berg et al 1998).   The role of the AHR in mediating the toxic effects of planar hydrophobic contaminants has been well studied, however the endogenous role of the AHR is less clear [1]. Some endogenous and natural substances, including prostaglandin PGG2 and the tryptophan derivatives indole-3-carbinol, 6-formylindolo[3,2-b]carbazole (FICZ) and kynurenic acid can bind to and activate the AHR. [6][46][47][48][49] The AHR is thought to have important endogenous roles in reproduction, liver and heart development, cardiovascular function, immune function and cell cycle regulation [50][38][51][52][53][54][46][55][56][57] and activation of the AHR by DLCs may therefore adversely affect these processes."@en ;

  dc:description "The AO, Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) lies&nbsp;its emphasis on ovarian follicle counts as a key factor in assessing reproductive health. While currently optional in OECD test guidelines, the AOP underscores the strong link between follicle numbers and fertility, as well as their association with conditions like POI and early menopause. Regulatory frameworks should prioritize follicle depletion as a critical biomarker, not only for evaluating reproductive endpoints but also for advancing understanding of infertility-related disorders. Integrating follicle count assessments into mandatory criteria could improve the identification of reproductive toxicants and ensure better protection of women&#39;s reproductive health in regulatory decisions."@en ;

  dc:description "The female reproductive system includes the ovaries, fallopian tubes (or oviducts), uterus, and vagina, and is hormonally regulated by the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. All these organs function in conjunction to fulfil the main roles of the female reproductive system (1). The process that describes the growth and development of follicles, or atresia, through a sequence of morphological and functional phases from primordial to ovulatory is known as folliculogenesis (2). Oogenesis, the process of creating new primordial germ cells within the epiblast, starts in the human ovary at 2 weeks post-conception (wpc). The cells then move to the hind intestine, settle in the gonadal ridges before 7 wpc, and multiply into ovarian cysts, also known as nests, as oogonia. Primordial granulosa cells, which originate from the gonadal ridges, are also found in the cysts (3). The oogonia stops mitosis, expands, and mature into primary oocytes after 8.5 wpc, starting the meiotic prophase. The disintegration of the cysts, which takes place between 13 and 30 wpc, results in the development of 30-mm-diameter primordial follicles. These follicles are made up of a monolayer of squamous granulosa cells encircling a primary oocyte that has been arrested during the diplotene stage of prophase I of meiosis (4). According to theories, the newly produced primordial follicles serve as the female&#39;s limited supply of resting oocytes for the duration of her reproductive life (5). The number of primordial follicles formed within the ovary throughout development is the result of the widespread proliferation and death of primordial germ cells, oogonia, and oocytes (6). Females are born with an average of 400,000-700,000 primordial follicles, which diminish considerably over the reproductive lifespan (7).Follicles can be classified into three types:   	Nongrowing, primordial follicles are described as isolated oocytes or oocytes surrounded by a partial or intact single layer of granulosa cells. 	Growing follicles are described as oocytes surrounded by a multi-layered, solid covering of granulosa cells with no sign of a fluid-filled cavity (antrum). 	Antral follicles consist of a core oocyte and a fluid-filled antrum surrounded by hundreds of stratified granulosa cells (8).   POI is a medical condition in which ovarian follicles become exhausted and no longer function normally as reproductive and endocrine organs in women under the age of 40. It is characterized by low ovarian sex hormone levels and a reduced number of ovarian follicles, hastening the onset of menopause. This condition frequently results in subfertility or infertility due to hypoestrogenism, which causes menstrual abnormalities and pregnancy failures. Approximately 1% of women under the age of 40 experience POI (9). Four primary mechanisms can result in POI:   	Depletion of the reserve of dormant primordial follicles, either due to inherent factors leading to their failure in assembly or acquired reasons causing increased atresia. 	Increased occurrence of follicular atresia. 	Pronounced activation of primordial follicles. 	Interruption of follicular development before reaching the antral stages, thereby hindering ovulation (10).    Follicle depletion means that there are no follicles left in the ovary to undergo in further stages of reproduction. This condition can be caused by several factors, including failure to produce an adequate initial pool of primordial follicles during gestation, rapid follicle turnover, or autoimmune or toxic destruction of follicles (11).  The Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor (AHR) features a Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) domain that binds to a range of endogenous and exogenous substances. It is a member of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family. In its unliganded form, AHR is part of a cytosolic complex containing heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), the HSP90 co-chaperone p23, and the AHR-interacting protein (AIP). Upon ligand binding, AHR migrates to the nucleus where it dissociates from the cytosolic complex and forms a heterodimer with Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator (ARNT). The AHR-ARNT complex then binds to recognition sequences in the DNA, known as AHR response elements (AhREs) or xenobiotic response elements (XREs), which contain the core motif 5&rsquo;-GCGTG-3&rsquo;. These interactions lead to the induction or repression of gene expression&nbsp;(12). AHR controls the rate at which oocytes in germ cell nests undergo apoptosis during the embryonic stage, as well as the survival of oocytes in the ovaries of the foetus and newborn. Ligands of the AHR are classified into two categories: (i) anthropogenic compounds, which include aromatic environmental contaminants and various pharmaceuticals, and (ii) natural compounds, which are produced by bacteria, plants, animals, or the human body itself (13). Environmental factors known to activate AHR appear to be significant triggers of reduced ovarian reserve or early menopause, affecting both the prenatal period and adult life. These factors are believed to play a role in the development of POI (14). &nbsp;Apoptosis is the organized process of cell death characterized by membrane blebbing, cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, and DNA fragmentation, followed by the rapid engulfment of the cell remnants by neighboring cells. Often referred to as &quot;physiological cell death,&quot; apoptosis plays a crucial role in cell turnover, physiological involution, and the atrophy of various tissues and organs (15). The Bcl-2 protein family inhibits apoptosis by binding to and blocking pro-apoptotic proteins, such as Bax and Bak, preventing their translocation to the mitochondrial outer membrane. In the absence of Bcl-2 inhibition, Bax and Bak induce damage to the mitochondrial membrane, leading to the release of pro-apoptotic signaling proteins like cytochrome c. This release triggers the activation of the caspase cascade, which ultimately promotes apoptosis (Fig.2). When environmental contaminants activate the AhR, it leads to an increased production of pro-apoptotic proteins. This, in turn, causes apoptosis in ovarian follicles, resulting in follicular pool depletion and a reduced ovarian reserve (Fig.2) (16). Numerous studies have demonstrated that the biological effects of exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and other potent AhR ligands are consistent with the activation of AhR (17, 18). These studies have also shown that exposure to AhR ligand increases the expression of apoptotic genes, the production of Bax protein, and the subsequent Bax-dependent increase in apoptosis in murine oocytes.&nbsp; These findings highlight the roles that AhR signalling and apoptosis play in delayed follicle development, survival, and oocyte death (19).  Environmental factors influencing pregnancy or adulthood are significant predictors of ovarian reserve and early menopause. A cross-sectional study using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) involving 31,575 women from 1999 to 2008 found that, after adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, smoking, and body mass index, nine polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), three pesticides, one furan, and two phthalates among 111 endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) were significantly associated with an earlier onset of menopause, ranging from 1.9 to 3.8 years (10). Premature ovarian pool exhaustion, a primary characteristic of primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), was attributed to the combination of two common polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene and benzo[a]pyrene (BaP). This combination exposed fetuses to the mixture at an accelerated rate (20). Most of these environmental pollutants affect the ovaries through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), leading to follicular apoptosis at various stages. This results in a reduced number of follicles available for fertilization or menstruation, contributing to issues such as early menopause and infertility due to diminished ovarian reserve and exacerbating POI."@en ;

  dc:source <https://h2020-sbd4nano.github.io/sbd-data-aopwiki/models/> ;
  dc:description "The AOP for HCN Channel Inhibition Leading to Arrhythmias provides a mechanistic framework to understand how the inhibition of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels disrupts cardiac pacemaker function and culminates in arrhythmias. HCN channels mediate the Funny Current (If), which plays a vital role in the automaticity of sinoatrial (SA) node pacemaker cells. This current is crucial for initiating diastolic depolarization and maintaining the rhythmic contraction of the heart. Any disruption in HCN channel activity can profoundly affect cardiac electrical stability, leading to life-threatening arrhythmias. HCN channel inhibition is most commonly studied in the context of pharmacological agents, such as selective If inhibitors used to treat cardiovascular conditions. However, the pathway is also relevant to genetic mutations affecting HCN channels, indirect modulation by autonomic imbalances, and environmental factors that alter cardiac ionic currents. The AOP integrates evidence from molecular to organismal levels, providing a comprehensive framework to assess cardiotoxic risks. The pathway&#39;s applications span regulatory toxicology, drug safety evaluation, and therapeutic development. It enables the identification of cardiotoxic chemicals, informs the design of safer HCN modulators, and supports the development of diagnostic tools to predict arrhythmogenic risks. Additionally, it highlights the importance of personalized medicine approaches, such as genetic screening for HCN4 mutations, to tailor therapies and mitigate adverse outcomes.  &nbsp;"@en ;
